But he doesn't know which mangoes are good and which are not. 

You ask him to buy some mangoes and then every day when he brings them to you, you analyse and tell him which of them are good and which are not. You can say, that the one that are green outside are not good for consumption right away. So now he knows that next time he should not buy green mangoes. But he brings all stale mangoes next day.

A function is said to be recursive if it calls itself. You may ask, Why do you need to do that? A: As we write complex code, some difficult questions can be simplified by the use of recursion.
We can divide a problem into subproblems of the same type. This is called divide-and-conquer and is a top-down approach to problem solving. ie, solve smaller and smaller instances of the same problem. We can then combine them to get the solution.
Here's a factorial program using recursion.

// to get the factorial of a positive integer n
int factorial(unsigned int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
}
See the factorial(n-1) function called inside the factorial function. This allows us to make the solution concise and simple. 

Other examples include, traversing a binary search tree, generating a fibonacci sequence can be simplified using recursion. 
They can also be used to design beautiful objects called fractals, which are similar to objects found in nature.

","I might not find it hard so much now, but at the beginning it took me a while to understand the MVC concept, and I needed that for developing in Django. So if asked, I would explain it now like this:

When starting the application with Django, we first shape the models. The models are the core of our application, and we build everything around them. So think of writing an essay. You will start by structuring your essay in a logical way, taking away the key points that will be the foundations of the article. If we are writing about some artist, we would start by dividing the essay into biography, the works he/she had done, the collaborations with others, maybe divide chapters for each of the different kind of works they have done etc. If we are building a website for that artist, we want that structural separation of data as well, so we will be able to show it better. So in the models we would divide the information about the artist into one class, the works into another, maybe make different classes for different kinds of work etc. For a website, we would chunk that data more into detail. After building our information foundation, we need to do shape the main part of our essay and our website respectively. When having laid out the structure, we continue with going further into detail of the chapters, making sentences out of keywords and putting the facts to action. Same with the website, we than get to write what will be shown where and in what way and start making more sense of just having our facts in the models and in the database. These files, we call the views. After writing all, in the essay, you usually go at the beginning and being a long one, you write what chapter is on what page so people don't look trough the document. In Django, we have he urls file that tell us which function written in the views files should be open when we open a certain url, so we always get the information and action we want.....

For instance, I made a simple Chrome extension that resizes the margins of pages so turn a wall of text into a more readable column with just one keystroke. That project didn't just give me programming experience; it also improved my quality of life tremendously (or at least my quality of internet browsing).",Female,"I chose Java because it's the language my current programming class (data structures) is being taught in, so it's the one I'm most immediately familiar with. 

So far I've made a basic student registration system that consisted of multiple classes (the object-oriented kind, not the school kind) working together to create and update arrays of data. Prior to that, I made simple games and programs with C++, Python, and Javascript, so I'm familiar with the concepts those projects entailed as well (e.g. loops, parameters, pointers).","[This explanation assumes the reader knows everything mentioned except recursion, such as functions, printing, etc.]

Recursion is when a function calls itself. For instance, say you had a function called Bob. Let's say Bob can do two things: it prints ""Hi, Bob!"" and then calls itself. So if we run Bob, it prints ""Hi, Bob!"" and then runs itself again, so it prints ""Hi, Bob!"" again, then calls itself again, and so on.... 

That's an example with an infinite loop, but you can also use recursion for a limited number of times, just like a for-loop. For that, you need a ""base case"": when the recursive calls should stop. For instance, say you want your recursive function to count to 3. One way to implement that would be to make your base case 1: if the input is 1, then the function prints one and then ""unwinds"" through the calls to print the rest of the numbers. 

But the best way to understand recursion is through ""tracing"" the calls. Say this is our counting function in pseudocode: 

count(n):
if n == 1, print n
else, count(n-1)
print n

Tracing the calls is basically just keeping track of the input and output of each call. For count(3), tracing the calls to the base case looks like this:

count(3)   // (a) 3 is not 1, so it calls count(3-1), without printing anything
    --> count(2)
          --> count(1)  // (b) Since we've reached the base case, 1, 1 is printed. 

Now we go backwards through the calls, since they've been waiting for the return of the calls they initiated (start with (b)):

count(3)   // (d) After count(2) returns, count(3) goes to its next instruction and prints 3, and the function terminates. 
    --> count(2)  //  (c) This call still has ""print n"" left to run, so now that count(1) has returned, it prints 2.
          --> count(1)  // (b) 1 was printed. 

It's easier to show on a whiteboard with arrows and such, but that's the gist.",Yes,"For a couple years, I taught the reading and writing sections of the SAT to high school and junior high school students and privately tutored kids from ages 8-18 in algebra, reading, writing, history, etc.",1-3 hours per week,Yes,

Now your new function can call more functions and you need to remember its own state on top of the one you already remembered, this way you end up with a list representing the chain of execution - ""call stack"". Usually you have a fixed amount of memory to store that stack so once it gets too long you are not able to call more functions.

      return 1
   return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

I'd like to talk with her and see what spikes her interest and if there is some area where she could write a piece of software that she would then use. Keeping it close to personal interests of the person learning is in my opinion the key. If the answer needs to be independent of the personal interest of the person learning I would say that simple games usually serve quite well to keep the interest going, but that really depends on the person in question and can misfire badly. I don't believe there is one correct answer to this question other than ""it depends"".",Male,"Unfortunately my previous employer used Delphi and as such I haven't made any big projects in any modern language.
For private use I try to stick to C# and sometimes Java (usually when writing for Android). As to what kinds of projects I do for private use it varies quite a bit.

Despite all that I feel that I lack the experience coming from working in a big project and as such would prefer to teach someone the basics of programming rather than fall short on expectations from someone already experienced. Additionally I would really like to have a guideline as to what it would be good to teach, my previous attempts on teaching programming to beginners relied solely on what I would come up with (even for the person attending CS classes) and even though it seemed to work there is a lot of room for improvement there.","On a high level I would say the proper use of design patterns. Learning them is essential in avoiding mistakes, but just knowing them is not even half the battle. While knowing anti-patterns and avoiding them in your work is relatively simple, choosing which design patterns to use, and when and where to use it, is a nontrivial problem even in a controlled environment. When we add the complexity coming from working to a deadline in a less than perfect situation design patterns often become the first casualty.

When coming down to a lower level of programming concepts I would say that perhaps the proper use of threading. Threading in many projects is essential, but getting the hang of how they interact between themselves can quickly grow to become quite hard to get your head around it. In addition to being hard to design debugging can become a proper nightmare if your application is truly multithreaded, especially when your bug results from some intermittent race condition.",Yes,"So far I have mentored two persons who wanted to learn programming from scratch, both of them male, both in their twenties.

The head monkey clone arrives with a pen and notepad but decides it is too hard to count that many jellybeans so she divides the room into two halves and leaves, sending for two monkey clones to count the jellybeans in each half of the room. These two monkeys arrive at the room with their notepads and decide it is too hard to count that many jellybeans in their half of the room. So they each divide their half into half yet again and leave, sending for two more monkey clones each to count the jellybeans. This means four monkey clones arrive in the room with their notepads and each inspect their quarter of the room to count. Each of these monkeys decide there are too many jellybeans to count and leave, sending for two more monkey clones each. 

This process continues until there are as many monkeys in the room as jellybeans. Each monkey clone arrives and is happy to find they can count one jellybean. They each write down the number 1 on their notepad and return to the monkey that called them, which uses a calculator to add 1 + 1. That monkey clone writes down 2 on their notepad and in turn returns to the monkey that called them, and so on. Each pair of monkeys returns to the monkey that has called them, each carrying larger and larger numbers on their notepad. Eventually the two monkeys the head monkey has called return with two large numbers written on their notepads. The head monkey clone adds these two numbers and writes the sum on her notepad. The head monkey clone returns to you and presents the sum of jellybeans on her notepad.

The problem of counting the jellybeans acts as a problem to be calculated. Each monkey acts as a recursive function, calling copies of itself to divide the problem further and further into smaller pieces until a base case (one jellybean) is found.

Unlike class based inheritance where we have classes derive behavior from other classes by extending them, prototype based inheritance uses the objects themselves as a source of behavior. An object (having prototypical behavior) can be used to create new objects exhibiting the same behavior by a process called construction. The new objects will have the same behavior found in the original object + additional behavior of their own. Whenever the prototypical behavior changes in the original object, it will change also in all the constructed objects.

If I would have to explain it it would be the following way:

Mom and Dad are both Persons. They both eat, sleep or work. A Person usually sleeps 8h a day, so do Mom and Dad. Mom is a vegetarian but Dad likes eating meet. Mom works as an assistant at the hospital and Dad is an economist.  

We can see that both Mom and Dad do the activities of a Person, but they do some of the activities is a different manner (such as eating and working). 

Let's say that we are in the same room as Mom and Dad and we ask: What do the Persons in this room like to eat? Mom will say vegetables and Dad will say meat. The reason why both Mom and Dad replied to this question is that they ARE Persons, so all the questions we ask to Person we ca ask to them also.

So Polymorphisme consists of using a interface (Person) which  defines the common behavior for objects/classes (Mom and Dad) that will either have the default behavior or override it with their own. As Mom is a Person we can find out all the information about her that it is typical to a Person, such as her profession.

1. Write higher/lower game - program should draw a number between X and Y, and play with user. User try to guess number and program give one of three answers: 
A. My number is higher
B. My number is lower
C. Yeah! You Win :)

Also program should count how many times user try to find out this random number.

This application shows simple interaction with user. I can show some basic concepts like variables, loops, conditionals. And- it's still a game, very simple, but for first ""own"" game ever its still funny :)

2. More advanced concept is to create simple web application with database. For example make guest book or shopping list. You can learn from this how to create entities for database, how to load data, how to send it to user interface and so on. But still- this one is for someone who know basic concepts of Java language.

3. Write application that can find if word specified by user is palindrome or not. We can evolve this application to find all palindromes in text file.

Currently in my spare time I develop my skills in  Play! framework and Akka. (Also I love Scala and Groovy :))","I guess ""Hard for beginner"". So lets use term ""Immutable"" in Java.

Immutable object its some kind of object that have one state and just can't be changed (never ever). So we can create that kinds of objects but after its created we never be able to change it. In java, there are a lot of immutable objects. For example all from java.lang package. String is one of them. If you check string methods You will find out that every method that should change object just return new one. Look at split()  or trim() method. 

You can't use

String myString = ""   This    is     sparta!!!     ""
myString.trim();

trim() method returns a copy of this string with leading and trailing white space removed (or this string if it has no leading or trailing white space). 

return a copy - key information. So You should always:

String myString = ""   This    is     sparta!!!     ""
myString = myString.trim();

or

String myString = ""   This    is     sparta!!!     ""
String trimedString = myString.trim();


Of course You will ask - why I need Immutable classes? It's a very good question! First of all when You create a class and agregate other class in this class (for example our string) and create getMyString() method then You are sure that no one (not event You) can change value of Your string in this class from outside. Look at this example:

public class A {

private String myString = ""     This is sparta!!!!       ""

 public String getMyString() {
   return myString;
 }
}

----
public class B {

  private A a = new A();

  public someMethod() {
    a.getMyString().trim();
  }

}


What happens when I invoke someMethod()? Nothing!! Because String is immutable.

There are some more advantages from using immutable classes, but there are more complicated- we need first to talk about concurrent applications so we will back to this topic later.",Yes,"First of all I used to be an academic teacher in Silesian University of Technology.

The owner of the company (your application) knows how to bake a perfect cake but he needs some machines to do so (this machines are external classes, either written by ourselves or someone else). He already bought the machines, huge, complex and hard to configure. He has two choices - to install this machines and configure them by himself (they have very good manuals, like veeery good) or ask the manufacturer to do it for him (for free) and be sure thay're configured properly. He can spend some time doing it by himself (this is the way it is without DI - you have to configure all components you need by yourself), but he spends his time (in our application it would be writing additional code) and he risks making mistake (even though the manuals are detailed, they are as I said very complex and he can miss some point). The alternative is to have it done by himself. Also, as he's very good in business, he owns thousands of companies (a lot of our classes in complex projects), if he was to install the machines by himself, he won't be able to think about his business.

Reason why I chose it: I was tackling it today and it seems interesting to share especially since it requires a bit of knowledge about compilers and the compile phases.

Explanation: The compilation is the stage that transforms the code that we have written to a piece of code that the machine you are working on can understand ( not all machines talk the same language so it's important to have this step so we can talk to all of them). 
This process takes time and in the interest of speeding it up there are many optimizations that can be done. One of the things that a programer  can do is make sure that we don't do redundant transformations. That is where the Precompiled Headers come in. If we know that most of our files use some piece of code we can specify it in the beginning and the compiler will shape it in a way that will make processing each application easier.

Example:
It's as if we are trying to add the same piece of paper to each of 12 folders. One way to do it is write the same thing on a new page for each of the folders and add each one to the pile. Another way is to write it once and xerox it and then add it to each folder. 

You still have to create the first page and you still have to do the work of adding each paper in the folder, but since you are xeroxing it's a much faster process.",No,,1-3 hours per week,Yes,

1. Possible to get near immediate feedback and fast wins such as a simple user interface and avoiding the need to set-up lots of framework which is abstract and often invisible background work.
2. Extensibility as motivation while being able to develop small self-contained pieces.

As examples I could suggest:
1. A simple ToDo list or calendar, which can be extended to include more advanced features such as sharing with friends or pictures later on.
2. If the person is interested in diet or exercise, a simple tracker, again can be extended later with nutrition db lookups or sharing mechanisms.
",Male,"Java is my professional language of choice and I have been involved in a variety of enterprise frameworks such as Spring, Guice, Hibernate, EJB, JAXB, Axis and Jersey. I have also done extensive work with lower level concepts such as concurrency including thread and heap dump analysis. I am also familiar with the Android framework.

My MSc dissertation was implemented in Python for computer vision using the OpenCV library and its related usage of scipy, numpy. I also got a good grasp of  many python specific ways of handling files, slicing arrays, lambdas, etc.","Concurrency:

To understand the concept of concurrency it is necessary to recall that source code is typically executed one instruction at a time and one after the other. For example in a calculator you have one instruction to calculate the value and another instruction for displaying the value to the user. This is useful because as a programmer it is important that we know that the calculation happens before displaying the value because otherwise the value displayed could be incorrect.

While this typically works well in a calculator, unfortunately sometimes this principle can cause problems. For example an oversimplified version of an instruction set for a website could be:

Loop Wait for Incoming request:
1. Receive Request for user
2. Retrieve and calculate requested values from database
3. Return values to user

Since a website is of course commonly used by more than one person this is a problem as if all instructions are performed after another and in the given order, the second user will have to wait until the first user is finished. This is where concurrency comes in. Concurrency means that any given instruction can be executed concurrently or parallel with another instruction. In the example above, the web server could process one request while also processing the second request at the same time.

This is great, so why are we not programming concurrently in general? The answer is that in practice, concurrency is hard. The main reason is that programs often include some form of state. Following the example of a website, imagine a website that has a counter how often the website has been visited. So each time a user visits the website that value is:
1. Read from a database
2. Incremented by 1 and
3. Stored updated value in database
When these three instructions can be executed concurrently for each user, we can run into a problem that is called a race-condition. Imagine the following scenario with the value 100 visits in the database:

1. User 1 reads 100 from database
2. User 1 increments value to 101
3. User 2 also reads 100 from database, because user 1 has not yet stored the new value in the database
4. User 1 stores 101 into database. User 1 has finished.
5. User 2 increments value to 101
6. User 2 also stores 101 in database but should have been 102. User 2 has finished.

As you can see the wrong value is stored in the database and the second user is basically ignored in the count. The solution is to synchronise parts of the instructions and make the second user wait for the first to read, increment and write before reading from the database itself. Note that by synchronising only these 3 instructions we are slowing down the timer incrementation because the one user has to wait for the other, but we are not going back to the original solution, where everything has to wait for the first user to be finished. Finding this trade-off is what makes synchronisation a very hard subject and should best be avoided by not using a shared state in your code. But of course that is not always possible.",Yes,"I have not been formally assigned a teaching role, however my previous workplace had a strong mentoring culture for new Junior Employees.

In general code executes line by line. However, there are situations in which your program would have to wait for something else. One of the most common examples of that might be a request to get some data from a website or a call to database. While it's okay to wait it's also quite wasteful as no other operations may be performed in the meantime.

Utilizing asynchronous (or non-blocking) code we would issue the command (ie. get all users from the db) along with a callback - a function that will be executed when the task is done. The code is non-blocking though - that means after executing the line with command and callback the program immediately executes next line. This might lead to some difficulties in reading the code ( when the natural, line-by-line type of execution is disturbed ) but provides good perfomance and natural feel to coding interactions with other systems (in a broad sense that includes a human interacting with a mouse or keyboard too).

Different languages handle it differently, but programmers always need to worry about memory management.  A language like C++ requires you to allocate memory explicitly and also free it explicitly.  Objective-C uses reference counting to keep track of memory usage.  Java has a Garbage Collector -- a process that keeps track of referenced memory and can clear it from time to time.  Each of these systems has its advantages and weaknesses.  When a programmer fails to free up memory, it's known as a memory leak.  It can be hard to tell if you have a memory leak, so there are programs called profilers that make it easier -- they can show you how the program is using memory in real time.

- the number of the square - for example 8, is the address of that square in the grid
- now inside each of those squares we can have variables/values; every variable in your program will have a square assigned, square inside which it will store a value; for example we have:
foo = 1
foo will have square number 8 assigned for example, and inside square number 8 it will we written 1
- squares hold numbers, and addresses (like 8 is the address of square number 8) are numbers; considering this you can put a number in a square; the number will represent the address of another number; that's what a pointer is -> a pointer is a variable who's value is an address",No,,3-5 hours per week,Yes,

Sometimes, different components of the machine need to speak to other components (e.g. share or store a variable), and this should also be noted down as something that adds to the overall analysis of the algorithm.

Explanation:
This thing occurs when one class inherits from two other classes that both have a common base class (directly or indirectly inherits from the same class). Lets call them B -- common base, L -- left child, R -- right child and F -- final class. In the class diagram we could present this problem as:
   B
  /  \
 L   R
  \  /
   F
In this situation in C++ if you would have an object of a class F and would call its member function that it inherits from B class the call would be ambiguous. Trying to compile a program that calls such method for an instance of F class will cause a compile error.
This is because objects of F class has actually two copies of B class objects, one for L object and one for R object. To address this issue you can use virtual inheritance. If Both L and R class are virtually derived from B class then objects of F class will have exactly one object of B class. Thanks to this the calls for methods inherited from B class will no longer be ambiguous.
The same applies to member attributes of base B class accessed from F class level.",Yes,"I have taught my younger brother, he was at his 20's and the subject was object oriented programming. Also I have helped him with assembler.",5-7 hours per week,Yes,

We have frontend and backend webapps as well as daemons and batches. 99% of the code is Java, but we still have some old tools written in perl.

Development teams are in charge of maintaining code that belong to them as well as writing new projects, as the need arises.","It would definitely be a web application targeting something which is not IE. Main reasons is that web runs everywhere and it's easy to ave something working in a relatively short amount of time and thus, the gratification comes quickly, keeping my friend motivated to continue. Sure it requires her to learn a bit of HTML/CSS as well but I don't think HTML is hard to understand.

The application would be something useful for her, starting with a small prototype and improving it as the time passes. I think the application is not that relevant as long as it can start small and still being useful (and we can almost always find a way to make that possible).",Male,"Java - my everyday language at work. Virtually all projects are written in Java, using frameworks such as Hibernate or Spring (mainly core).

I'm also developing a unit/integration/... tests database fixture loader  which is spring and hibernate based. The idea is to be able to load fixtures from various sources, such as Excel documents, XML files and SQL scripts. The data can be committed, in case the method under test needs to execute some code in a different transaction than the test method, or not. The framework supports both modes.

A second aspect of this project is to have the possibility to assert database content, using the same kind of sources than the ones used to populate the database.

The project is hosted on github: https://github.com/cpollet/jixture and has a presentation (not finished at the time of this writing): http://cpollet.github.io/jixture
You can find some Javadoc here: http://jixture.cpollet.net/jixture-core/apidocs/index.html","During my studies, I was asked to explain by a girl from another faculty (who somehow took programming courses) the difference between abstract classes and interfaces in Java - she knew the difference but didn't understand why we would ever need an abstract class.

I didn't want to go too much in technical details, but I said her that sometimes, you have different classes that share a common behavior. Having just an interface is not always the way to go because it may happen that the 2 classes, say A and B, have the same implementation for a given method and it's not good to duplicate the exact same code in two difference places.

To solve this issue, you would create a super class, say C, that implements this particular method and then make your A and B extend that superclass C. Doing so, both A and B will fulfill the interface's contact, but you've created another problem: one could create an instance of C. This is not what you want because C is not complete and cannot be used on its own. In that case, you make C abstract to prevent someone to instantiate it.

A real-life example would be: we are in a shop with goods to buy. All goods (for instance a Book, a Pen, etc.) have a price. The Cart has to compute it's value and it's convenient for it just ask each goods what their price is. We can imagine that every goods extends a Good class, which  implements a getPrice() method that returns the price for that good, in order to not have to repeat it in all Book, Pen, etc. If the BaseGood is not abstract, everyone could create an instance of it, but it does not make any sense in real life, since it would be something (we don't know what) - an abstract object - that has a price. Same is true in Java and that's why we would mark the BaseGood as abstract.",Yes,"I mentored a master's thesis in my current company. The student was 25 at that time.

The goal would be to have some structure or some amount of money in a given number of turns. There could be random catastrophes that destroy part of your buildings or it can be a multi-player game using turns. It can be very very simple but complexity layers can be added.

If my friend wants to learn UNIX internals, I would suggest a simple UNIX console in C.

Java is the language that I used for my PhD Thesis. I wrote the shared memory communications device of FastMPJ (http://torusware.com/product/fastmpj/) a MPI for Java library that is being sold by a start-up established by people from my uni. I also contributed to the MPJ Express open source library (http://mpj-express.org/contributors.html). ","The difference between a Union and a Struct in C. It is not especially complex unless you are new to the language. 

Structs and Unions are defined similarly. Let's see an example:

struct st{
int a;
char b;
}st;

union un{
int a;
char b;
}un;


Struct st is used to express a variable with several components: an element that contains both an integer and a character. For example, the code of a product and its price. 
E.g.
struct st fruit; fruit.a = 10; fruit.b='b';

In memory, the variable fruit occupies sizeof(int)+sizeof(char) (i.e., the sum of the size of its components). Each component is stored in a different memory location.

A variable union un  occupies just the size of its longer component in one memory location. 'a' and 'b' are just *names* for the same variable with different types. If we do:
union un fruit; fruit.a=10; fruit.b='b';
With fruit.b='b' we are overwriting fruit.a.
This is because the purpose of an union is to represent a variable that can have different types.

You type the data  2.5  6.7 into your keyboard.  Notice that instead of providing an integer for the integer variable, you have provided a floating point number.  Think of each of the characters you type entering  a pipe that flows from the keyboard to the program.  The program will try to read an integer, It will look at the character waiting at the end of the pipe and see a 2.  That  2 can be part of an integer so it is read into the variable. Then the program will look at the pipe again and see a . (decimal point).  A decimal point cannot be part of an integer so it assumes it has finished reading the integer and the value of the integer is 2.  Then it tries to read the floating point number.  It looks in the end of the pipe and sees the decimal point. The decimal point can be part of a double variable so it reads it into the variable. Then the program goes back to the pipe to see what is available next. It sees a 5. A 5 can be part of a floating point number so it reads the 5 and adds it to the floating point variable (now .5).  Then the program goes back to the pipe and checks what comes next, it sees a space.  White space (spaces, tabs, new lines) are special, they mean that the program has finished reading the variable.

It basicly states, that if we have a parent class, we have to be able to replace it with the child class without altering the logic. It is understandable, that if an objects inherits from another object, they both share the same ""base"" properties - a race car is a car, so they both share properties like wheels - everytime we are using methods car-specific, we can definitely use methods of the race class. The method drive, will cause the car to drive, in a race car specific way. This is exactly the Liskov Substitution principle.
However, a class representation of the objects does not have the same properties as the object itself, so it does not share the same relations with the parents, which makes the concept harder to use in practice.
We might be tempted to implement a square as a child class of the rectangle (as the square is certainly a rectangle). BUT it violates the principle. Why? We see that a rectangle would have properties of length and width, set separately. But a square cannot, all the sides are of the same length. Implementing the methods to get the length for the square would require adding unexpected behaviour to setLength method in the square (e.g. setting another dimension simultaniously) - it is wrong, because the user of the class rectangle cannot know that something like this will happen and might not act accordingly.

Though not the right place, I would like to share my preference.

C, C++, Java, python -> experienced woman
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby -> newbie woman","Maybe, Dynamic programming !
I would explain it through a example.. like simplest, factorial/fibonacci. 
1) Consider if I ask you to find factorial of 1783. Difficult?eh ?
2) But what if I give you factorial of 1782. Simple. Just multiply value of  factorial of 1782*1783, right ? 
3) Consider if I ask you to find factorial of 1782. Difficult?eh ?
4) But what if I give you factorial of 1781. Simple. Just multiply value of  factorial of 1781*1782, right ?  and so on and so forth.

So, treating the answer to the subproblem as a black box, giving you the correct answer at each and every point, you just need to use that answer from the blackbox with the some modifications to find the solution of the entire problem. This is called top-down method of dynamic programming(dp). To make it more clear, I will then take some more dp examples like coin-change, longest increasing subsequence, longest common subsequence etc. Then I would proceed to write the code of DP (if recursion concept is known, then its easy or else I will start with recursion)

For example let take a integer variable 'x' where address of the memory allocated for x is say '100' and the value at that memory allocation is '5'.

you can access the value by just writing x while for accessing memory address you should write '&x'

Now, I am declaring a pointer p which points to memory address of x
int *p;     // declared a integer pointer
p = &x;  // p contains address of x

for getting the value at memory allocation x you should write `*p`.

","The virtual mechanism is a very important concept in object-oriented programming. A virtual function  is a function whose behavior can be overridden within an inheriting class by a function with the same signature. It is an example of polymorphism. In C++, the virtual keyword it is used when declaring a function.
To implement virtual functions, C++ uses a special form of late binding known as the virtual table. The virtual table is a lookup table of functions used to resolve function calls in a dynamic/late binding manner. 

Example
class Base
{
   public:
   virtual void display()
  {
      printf(”Base\n”);
  }
};

class Derived : public Base
{
   public:
   void display()
   {
       printf(”Derived\n”);
   }
};
void main(){
    Base *p = new Derived();
    p->display();
}
In the above example, the pointer is of type base but it points to the derived class object. The display method of the derived class is called and not that of the base. The method display() is virtual in nature. In order to resolve the virtual method call, the context of the pointer is considered. If the method was not virtual, the display() method of the base class would have been called.

i = i+1; // this is not the same as 2i = 1; or i = 1/2;

The equals sign is called an assignment operation. Operations are processed one after the other. In this case the last operation to be executed is the assignment.

An assignment has two components: a value and a storage destination. In our case the storage destination is i and the value needs to be calculated.

When we calculate the value we take the current value of i and execute the addition. Now we have the value and complete the assignment operation by storing the value in the storage destination (which happens to be i) thus overwriting the initial value of i with the new value.


II) Pointers.

Variables in programming languages are storage destinations the program knows how to directly access and use.

A program may read, write or use in operations most storage destinations (variables) directly.

A pointer is a storage destination (variable) which only contains the address of another storage destination (variable) kind of like desktop shortcut files which are files who only contain the address of the actual file being used.

The program treats pointers like any other variable allowing you to read or write the value being stored in it which happens to be the address to another variable.

The program can however be instructed to access the value being pointed to much the same way as clicking on a shortcut opens the destination file not the shortcut file.",Yes,"Personally I have helped friends learn basic programming.

Information  is  available,  accessible,  and  consumable  from anywhere,anytime. Interoperability is seamless. Change is cost-effective and manageable. I analyzed the requirements and proposed a solution that would integrate in the current architecture and would fulfill the requirements. The solution I proposed included:- Changing the old architecture with a new one, that could be integrated easily with our new projects- Replacing an external IBM product which required license with an &quot;in house&quot; product- Maintainability and development flexibility for the future-  ESB is an environment independent solution which can be deployed on Tomcat, Jboss or WAS-  Performance compatibility - competing with a tuned product that has been on market for many years wasnot the goal of our transformation; the scope was to obtain the same performance and improve monitoring. The solution  I  have proposed has  been  accepted  by  the  customer  and  resulted  into  a  first  prototype which respected all the  goals mentioned above and it represents a starting point for the future transformation.

Among the projects, I remember writing a chat client-server system using sockets, programming the IBM Cell processor (think PlayStation 3) and also the control program for the autonomous robot in my Bachelor thesis (sensor data, motor actuation, strategy, etc).

C++ was needed during my computer graphics classes since it was much simpler to define graphical scenes in terms of OOP. My project was to simulate the propagation of waves on a water surface, which was stored as a heightmap, which changed in time according to the wave equations (parameterized sin functions).
Currently, during my PhD, I am developing my own petroleum field simulator. The rock is fractured and these fractures can be represented using graphs. Moreover, there are classes for the petroleum wells, the numerical grid, etc, and the code is linked against a linear system solver library (PETSc, which uses BLAS and LAPACK).

Java is my go-to language when it comes to OOP and/or graphical interfaces. In Bachelor's we had to design a chess AI in a team. Thus it was easier to split tasks in terms of OOP: each team member had its own set of classes to develop.
I'm also using Java for my PhD as a visual fracture network generator (think: graphs). The user can draw the fractures using the mouse and change their properties, while the software takes care of the data structures (connectivity lists, connected grid cells, etc).

Matlab is a user-friendly but powerful language used by mathematicians to build computer models, do statistics, solve equations, etc. My Master thesis was developed in Matlab, where I had to used a reservoir simulator (as a black-box) and do statistical inference on its input parameters. This also involved solving linear systems of equations.","I know most people struggle understanding pointers and pass-by-value or pass-by-reference. 

Say your program is managing a photo album and you provide a function which flips photos upside-down. Now, the way functions work is that they make copies of their arguments, which they are free modify and return to the user. This is called pass-by-value. So if you'd pass your photo directly to this function, you'd get back its upside-down copy. In most situations, this is wasteful - you'd need twice the memory and you're not really interested in keeping the original photo.
So how do you tell the function to work on your photo directly and not make a copy? Well, you should provide the function with a pointer - which is a variable which stores the memory address where your photo is stored. This way, the function will access that memory and modify your photo accordingly. So, in this case, you used pass-by-reference - that is, you didn't give the function the value of your data, but showed it where to find it in memory.
Now, think about your pointer - since it's passed as an argument to your function, what does the function do with it? It first makes a copy! So the pointer is passed-by-value, but the photo is passed-by-reference.",Yes,"This has happened a couple of times:
* during Bachelor, I've organized a couple of after-school sessions, where I explained the basic concepts of C to my class-mates (preprocessor, memory allocation, pointers, simple data structures such as lists and graphs).
* during Master I was a teaching assistant for 3 courses. One of them meant supervising students during their Matlab programming lab sessions + inspecting their reports. The others were more about correcting assignments and exams.
* last year, I was the author of 2 lab assignments for a computer security course [1] [2] and the related exam subjects.

Junior Software Developer – Hostway Romania

As a R&D junior at Hostway Romania, I have contributed to the implementation of the user interface for a platform that speeds up the delivery of products to customers. To be more specific, I have had the opportunity to improve my JavaScript knowledge by automatically
generate specific parts of UI in order to facilitate the calls to the project’s API. This way, I have been able to improve the communication between the backend and frontend modules and tackle functionality issues in order to improve the users’ experience.


July 2013- October 2013
Software Developer Intern– Hostway Romania

During my internship, I have improved my understanding of JSON-RPC concept, being able to contribute to the development of a big project’s API. In this view, I have had the chance to deepen my knowledge regarding Python and build a client for JSON-RPC in order to facilitate
the API calls for Python programmers. Moreover, I have developed a module responsible for overcoming security problems concerning SSH communication for our clients. My responsibilities also included finding bugs and general functionality issues, testing and improving our API.","I think that the best idea would be to think about something that she likes or something that she would like to benefit from and she could do by developing an application. This way, she would combine the satisfaction of doing something useful for her and other people, while learning how to really do it. 

For instance, as a girl, I think that she would be motivated to make an application that keeps track of her clothes and depending on the weather outside, or the occasion, to recommend her how to dress. This way, she would learn how to store all the data and to retrieve it by using a framework, a service. She would learn how to use web services like the ones provided by Google in order to obtain weather information, thus she would learn to make REST calls to used APIs. All of these by taking baby steps, writing from simple to meaningful code in order to get it done.",Female,"As far as Java is concerned, during my experience as Junior Software Developer for Endava Bucharest, I have had the opportunity to improve my knowledge taking part in the development of BikeXpertRacing - Application for a Professional Cycling Team. Basically, this is a Java Web Application that helps this team to promote themselves, by writing articles and publishing them, as well as administrating the whole process. It is actually a combination between Facebook and Wordpress.
 
The interesting and challenging fact about this is that I have had the opportunity to work for it, going through all the layers, from repository to presentation. However, my main contribution was for the backend part. I have worked for the persistence layer, using Hibernate as framework and DAO as pattern. Moreover, I have worked in Spring MVC framework fashion, using dependency injection, bean management, Interface pattern in order to obtain a loose coupling and high cohesion accordingly.

As far as Scala is concerned, I am currently developing my skills and learning how to think more in terms of functional programming, by contributing to the development of a innovative project for Endava Bucharest. This is a brand new experience for me, since the project uses the principles of Reactive Programming, applying the Actor Model by benefiting from the greatness of Akka framework. In order to get accustomed with these concepts before starting to work for this project,  I have completed the Functional Programming Principles and Principles of Reactive Programming courses on coursera.org.","A lot of OOP newcomers struggle at the beginning to understand the Encapsulation fundamental principle. I know that because I was in the same situation.

I have always managed to learn new things by making associations to real life. For instance, the first thing that comes to my mind when talking about Encapsulation is a remote control for TV. As a user, I only use the buttons to get the desired functionality and I do not care about the things that are inside it. If I did, I would probably mess things around since I do not really know how they work and how should I put them together again to restore its main functionality. Consequently, I should mind my own business, and let people that know those objects(fields) to change things inside the remote control. What does this have in common with Encapsulation? Well, Encapsulation deals with this way of hiding information from users that do not need to know it in order to perform taks. I do not need to know what's inside a remote control in order to switch the TV channels or to turn on/off the TV.

Arrays can be allocated in two ways, either statically or dynamically. To allocate statically the size of the array should be known during compilation else go for dynamic allocation. 

During dynamic allocation the array is allocated on the heap during run time. So, a pointer should be declared to point to the allocated heap space. Dynamic allocation can be done using malloc as follows, malloc((size)*sizeof(int)); for allocating size ints. 
After that you need to release the memory when you are done, for that use free() function.

It is especially difficult due to the ""by value"" nature of passing arguments to functions.
To explain this, I will ask to imagine a hotel with rooms. Each room having a room number. Hotel rooms needs to be cleaned, so let's create function clean, which will clean all hotel rooms that are not occupied. If a manager(let's call it main) ask cleaner to clean, he wants to have his hotel cleaned, not some other, especially not the copy of his hotel. That's why the argument is passed by reference(although in fact(and in C terminology), it is special array pointer). In case of other data, ie. integer, you as a programmer are given possibility to pass arguments by pointer or by value, where by value is the default. It means that value will be copied on stack in function call frame.
Now the technical reason for such behaviour is that arrays may be huge, and passing arguments to function requires them to be copied on stack. This means that for each call there will be need to copy a huge amount of data on stack and as memory copying is slow operation it is avoided in default behaviour, but again programmer may copy array if needed.",Yes,"Right now I can think about 2 things that I have taught others.

At first, it is hard to think how would the machine interpret the code. But with practice it becomes a fun to think how to program some problem ;)

Nowadays programming languages are so high level that it is easy to code but a lot of people think that you have to be very smart to do it. I can tell that not - I didn't program before my studies, so everything is possible ;)",No,,3-5 hours per week,Yes,
