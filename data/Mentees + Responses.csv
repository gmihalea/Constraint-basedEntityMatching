Languages Preferred:

PHASE (1):
--first week-- 
[a]The first task that is to be done in the project mentioned above is the thorough understanding of the current version of kalzium application. Though this step we come to know the exact the area of modification and modules which need to be upgraded.
--two and a half weeks---
[b]As the areas which need to b ported onto framework 5 are now know, the very next task will be of modifying those areas

MID-TERM EVALUATION.
The mentor may have a view over the updated project and the required rectifications will be jotted down.

PHASE (2):
--three to four days--
[a] All the flaws must be rectified as per mentor's guideline.
--two weeks--
[b]Followed by adding on the additional features which may help in making the application more effective and attractive.

PHASE (3):
--one week--
[a]Last step will be completing documentation and re-viewing and submitting project for final evaluation.

PROJECT OUTCOME:
The existing application has been updated to the latest version i.e framework 5 which contains complete knowledge about the subject along with best example and 3D modeled diagrams.
BENEFITS TO THE COMMUNITY:
Students and visitors of any age and course can easily learn about any element or component along with 3D views,

I think it must be a quite complicated task, especially for a begginer, I trust it would take me longer than one month to change the layout. I would then find out how to add the geo location (probably using google maps), I'm guessing this is a less time-consuming task, but I may be mistaken. As for adding new sections, it may be worth adding them (even if blank) when changing the layout. I would then research for their content. Finally, the newsletter needs a secure database where to store the data provided by the users (their email addresses). Developing the layout of the newsletter is a final, nonetheless timeconsuming task.

I really want to become a scholar in the program „Learn IT,girl!”, because I see daily my young girls( aged 17-30) in the high school where I teach how helpless they feel,when they see themselves without the help of their parents or boyfriends,without any kind of financial help, situation that often make them vulnerable for persons with bad intentions.

By participating in this project I wish to stimulate European cooperation between the Romanian female youth I`m working with and other European persons working in the youth field, to develop confidence, self-motivation and  understanding of their rights (civil and religious) and responsibilities both within their own Romanian  societies and Europe, ”a land of unlimited opportunities of mobility, exchanges, seminars, training opportunities, programs financing, that are often little known, little used but that represent an outstanding resource to form, learn, grow, and be able to better meet the challenges of a changing society”,making Europe a reality and a  concrete feeling , visible, and above all accessible  for GIRLS,whose unique chance to a BETTER FUTURE is only EDUCATION.
Moreover, I wish to take a more active role in as many programmes on promoting WOMEN ` RIGHTS and DEVELOPMENT as possible,being part in stimulating environments of learning ,meeting other NGO` s preoccupied with giving an equal start in life,getting more  familiar with the IT language and  methods( which I could implement in my return,in the Romanian NGO`s UNIFERO)sharing my vision with my European peers I`m going to meet in ” LEARN IT ,GIRL!”

For instance the most recent courses on LEADERSHIP are:TED 2-TRANSATLANTIC EDUCATORS DIALOGUE,Illinois, USA,Leadership Skills, MISP,UK ,“Effective Classroom Interactions: Supporting Young Children’s Development"",Virginia University,Mitología para emprendedores,Universidad de Alcala,«Innovación y emprendimiento. El nuevo paradigma del S.XXI»Universidad Europea de Madrid,«Habilidades y competencias a través del coaching personal (3.ª edición)»Universidad de Cantabria .All these trainings gave me unprecious opportunities to develop my LEARDERSHIP ABILITIES that made me able to deal with coordinating the project that I ve developed in Spain, initiated by the the Romanian Ministery of Education in collaboration in with the Spanish Ministery of Education,because the institutions only created the legal background and recommended a curricula, leaving all the specific initiatives to the teachers involved in the project: thus , I chose to involve local institutions/ representatives( mayors,local NGO`s- Rumanos sin fronteras,Home, for isntance; priest) in attaining the fundamental goal of the program: HELPING THE ROMANIAN STUDENTS to integrate themselves better in the Spanish society , first knowning better their own local culture and respect it more in order to able to respect the others` cultural heritage
","I`m  working for quite a while in several Etwinning projects , projects ERASMUS+ that are being developed on the TWINSPACE virtual platform, for instance.I can tell you about one of them ( I loved it so much)that is concerned with COOPERATION and HUMAN RIGHTS` DEFENCE ,in the framework of the GLOBAL EDUCATION framework:
http://desktop.etwinning.net/projects/project/69296 .It meant a lot for me and my gilrs,because meeting other female peers ,my young students had the great opportunity to get aware of different cultures and civilizations they  shared the ideas of learning-methods which are student-centered, fighting against racism,GENDER prejudices, xenophobia , developing their self-confidence  in a visible way,using Internet in the same time.
Another project Im very proud of is https://sites.google.com/site/virtualeclasscommunity/home ,where I helped my female students to reach specific goals,especially to promote their own Romanian culture in front of the Greek  female young ,peers,creating together a web site where we put the results of our research: http://virtualeclassproject.webs.com/ .
But the MOST RECENT PROJECT,REALLY BIG ,for me  AS A MENTOR and for my mentees was the project developed in the past shool year 2013-2014 in SPAIN on promoting the ROMANIAN LANGUAGE , CULTURE AND CIVILISATION in the Romanian comunity in Spain, especially.It was really important for me , because I had the strong feeling that I succeeded to build BRIDGES between 2 Peoples,that not very rarely enter conflictive relations,most frequently because of the gender prejudices on the Romanian women.","Java, Python, .NET, HTML, CSS, Node.js","The ROADMAP that will exploit newly gained information on IT programs will have the duration from OCTOBER 2014 to JUNE 2015. On the website we ll create using NODE.JS,we ll  put all the results of our PROJECT  EYSART - European Young Students Act and Read Together:
OCTOBER 2014-On October, the young people will get to know their etwinners using twinspace, blog and private emails. They are going to present themselves to their partners using photos or their presentation materials.The plan of work will be pretty flexible and accepted by all the partners and it will be cohesive with the curriculum of each school, containing a lot of joint activities aiming at recognition of our similarities and differences ,each of the participants reporting to other partners on their activities.First, the young Europeans meet each other on the internet and get familiar. An e Twinning module can be used at this point, like “Glad to meet you, European Etwinners”, which is quite proper for students of this age, as they can talk about themselves and their favorite free time activities. Pupils comment and give titles on their work, make the photo gallery and posted on Twin Space. Then, they discuss others’ partner school work in class and in a chat room or through videoconference (Skype). Additionally, the module “ Ambassadors of our Country” will be used, so the school-partners can exchange photos of their home towns/ their countries ,locate the partner schools and the recordings to learn a few basic words/ phrases in all the European languages involved .Next, we will embed both in an online interactive map maps.google.com/ or a website (still to be decided) the European countries involved in the project. NOVEMBER 2014-The Etwinners will recite fragments of literary works/ poems created by each partner`s national writer and, subsequently, they will upload them on YouTube, for instance.They will also prepare an actual modern song as ”Europe`s Skies” by Alexander Rybak(Karaoke) .Each partner will prepare one part of the song and then we will will mix up everything and build up a new, funny song made by students from different European countries, using for instance Windows Movie Maker (freeware video editing software by Microsoft).Pupils draw pictures to their favourite books that will be published on blogs and project diaries, others are invited too,teachers put pictures into the folder: Pictures on TwinSpace.After watching pictures, pupils will try to guess what are partners' books about and will put their ideas as interactive posters on glogster ” LET` S GUESS !” DECEMBER 2014- CULTURAL HERITAGE Christmas, New Year traditions and books on Christmas.The folklore of customs covers and carries on the oldest stratum of traditional culture. It includes primitive forms of thinking preserved in beliefs, rituals and practices the meaning of which was very often entirely forgotten by the practitioners, who observed them simply by virtue of tradition. Most representative in this sense appear to be the New Year customs, spreading from Christmas Eve (December 24 th) to Epiphany (January 6th), over the period of time known as ”The Twelve Days”. We invite our partners to present /describe the customs related to this period of time and discuss on a book which depicts Christmas! Pupils will make/draw/paint/compose a music/animated cards and will send to each partner from the project. They will tell how students from all over Europe celebrate God's Birth in their countries, what is the meaning of Christmas holiday what are their favourites Christmas book/fairy tale/movie/other, what are their favourite Christmas cartoon and about all they need for a perfect Christmas Dinner... In this activity, partners schools can organise with their students many activities which is about the Birth of Son of God or Christmas and our children will make different paintings,drawings,ornaments and cards for Christmas.Each partner can contribute according to what they are able to do: texts, photos, pictures, songs and music audio files, paintings, drawings, ornaments and Christmas cards. Additional information about your country's Christmas traditions is welcome, but not compulsory. Pupils/teachers prepare PowerPoint presentation about their work and partners work everything they have learned during the process. JANUARY 2015-Books vs.Ebooks:Holding a debate/ exchange opinions about “The book and/or the ebook” in our schools. Through a meeting at school with other generations, pupils will learn to situate themselves in time comparing past or present experiences related to this topic. Maybe a collaboration with teachers from universities/ researchers (guests from specialised publishing houses, cultural and educational magazines, librarians will take part). A questionnaire for our learners! A poster contest! A wallwisher! Poster contest for the learners.Students read 3-5 poems by Mihai Eminescu http://www.mihaieminescu.ro/en/literary_work.htm b. 1 juin students draw/film/photograph/search for suitable images/clips for key words, realize a poster to present/comment the poems and students vote/comments for the best personalized poster. FEBRUARY 2015-Internet Safety Resources. Netiquette. – workshop February 2012 (line of conduct on the internet, navigation, sites approved for their age, setting up a blog, Wiki etc.). MARCH 2015-Putting on stage a drama based on favourite book common for all partners . APRIL-MAY 2015-TRADITIONAL COSTUMES The clothes and the house, by their protection and identification functions resemble the people who created them. By reproducing the particular forms of the dressed and sheltered body, these have great identity value, concisely expressed by the Romanian saying: ”You recognise the tree by its bark/The man by his clothes. Both male and female costume show some uniform features in terms of the materials used, their cut, ornaments and colours. We invite our partners to describe their traditional costumes and to share the meaning of pieces. They can present some exhibitions from their towns/countries related to the traditional costumes.

====

Rust is one of those trendy topics in tech community. I have been reading some interesting stuff about the language and I want to try it, as it is statically typed, fairly low-level (compared to Python) and has a very interesting ownership schema (currently it lacks a garbage collector!). 

So I have started with this page - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/wiki/Community-libraries
I would like to write a Common Mark (standardized version of Markdown) parser for Rust. Firstly, because Rust has no markdown implementation and secondly, Common Mark group is willing to receive feedback and enhance their specs: ""Perhaps the best way to provide feedback is to implement your own CommonMark parser, as one of our major goals is to make Markdown easier to parse, and to eliminate the many old inconsistencies and ambiguities that made writing a Markdown parser so difficult."" 

Java
====

In case there is no mentor that has knowledge in Rust, I was thinking of trying Java and Android SDK. I would like to build an educational app for children to learn the alphabet, by connecting consecutive letters in a 5x5 grid. I have an implementation in Python Kivy, but I would like to make a native app. I have a Nexus 5 phone for development. ",Systers,"We had a little project for latest Github Data Challenge - Bug Life - http://9-volt.github.io/bug-life/

Since beginning our team of two have split the responsibilities and the interface we will have in order to connect the data and visualization. I had the data downloading and processing, since I like doing mostly back-end stuff. It was fun, especially by patching the library I have been using for github-api. 

There were sometimes frustrating moments, because of gaps found in github jsons, missing values or even issues. For example, the most peculiar thing is the temporary missing issue #1689 of backbone (well, it's back now). It required extensive testing with various github repos. Eventually it is a nice little tool to visualize issues, release cycles and tendencies of a repo.","I hold the initiative for creating and maintaining a wiki for our university group - http://faf.code.md/wiki/

I have deployed a mediawiki instance on a server, established the structure, wrote Code of Conduct and Contribution Guidelines. Also I have organized a wikithon to get people together to contribute to the wiki. We had about 10 attendees and have completed some important sections.","Most recently I was working on an REST API for a mobile application. The server-side is based on django-norel (mongodb) and django rest framework. Unfortunately it is close-source and represents a commercial app. But I consider it a major breakthrough for me as a developer.

The other ongoing project, started in summer, is Systers Portal. It is based on Django and represents a fairly standard website. The only difficulty consists in managing row level permissions, for which we have used django-guardian.

I completed postgraduate studies in project management.
I work in Disability Support Service of Jagiellonian University, firstly at DARe-learning project creating e-learning for academic teachers (www.darelearning.eu) now as a coordinator of the team of people that adapt the materials for the blind persons. 
I volunteered in R2 Foundation and worked in their project team.

","I am working full time, I am a volunteer",5-7 hours per week,"I’ll be totally honest. I want to change my life and work. I didn’t have enough courage to decide to study IT when I was in high school but now I know that this is what I really want to do.
I was searching for some resources to learn coding and fortunately found this programme. I’m very motivated to learn and I hope that having a mentor and a project to work with will be additionally motivating. I’m especially interested in UX and I feel that at least basics knowledge of programming is necessary to do it properly. 
I’m a volunteer in NGO where I create websites and do other IT work, so I will be able to test my newly acquired skills and develop tools to help the organization and in the same time gather new experience which can be after that very useful in finding new job. 
",Good enough,none,I would like to make web applications that can be useful for my organisation. We'd like to prepare educational game for kids about corporate social responsibility. So far I have only the vague outline of the game because I'm now sure what and in which language I can do.,Geek Girls Carrots,"I was assistant project manager in a big project from EU funds held at Jagiellonian University. www.DARelearning.eu 
The main challenge was to organise work of team consisting people from France, Greece, Czech Republic and Poland. Through the implementation of good communication system and establishing the deadlines we manage to complete project and produced the high quality product.
The other challenge was to make sure that e-learning which we were creating was accessible for persons with disabilities. It needed hours of testing and close cooperation with IT specialist to make changes to moodle platform. 
","I was a leader of Scouting group for 3 years. My duty was to arrange activities and to organise trips for a group of young people. I had to simultaneously make sure that, on the other hand they are safe, but on the other that their voice is heard and they have the opportunity to engage in what interests them the most. I was closely cooperating with my deputy, who helped me a lot, and after my work had ended, took over my responsibilities. It was one of the most important experience in my life, I managed to face many challenges, had many beautiful moments and I’m still friends with people I worked with.

Secondly, I would like to work in a Digital Agency which means I need to know at least the basics of coding.",A friend,"Well, I am proud to say that I have recently graduated with honors from the IAA School, in Bucharest. The course was on Digital Strategy and Communication and for the two final projects (an individual one and a team project) we were required to create a digital strategy from scratch, and to offer communication solutions using innovative tools.

The main challenge was the fact that, unlike my fellow colleagues, I knew nothing about Digital Communication, or Strategy. I work in Advertising as a copywriter, but that's as far as my understanding of communication goes.

I managed to overcome this first challenge by asking a galling number of questions. Naturally, the second challenge was to deal with my irritated course mates :P

Regarding the team project, the only challenge was time. We had to find congruent hours to meet as many times was necessary to successfully complete it. Other than that, we were the perfect team, because we were always constructively challenging our solutions, and we were always capable of presenting better ones.

As to the individual project, my own challenge was to form a sane strategy based on a correct analysis, and thus offering the most innovative and compatible solutions.

I hope this was the kind of answer you required of me.
","I work as a project manager for one of the main accounts at my agency. This means I need to correctly asses the clients requirements, to challenge them if that is the case, and to explain them to the Client Service team (the people who actually manage the relationship with the client) so that they might accurately convey them.
I am required to offer realistic proposals (make sure the implementation team can actually bring the proposals to life). 
I need to make sure the proposals are not off budget.
I write the final presentation which includes the Art Directors' work (visuals and simulations), who are also directed by myself.
Finally, I am the one who holds the presentation in front of the client.
All this while I also do work on other accounts. That's why I came to think that time management is one of my greatest gifts.
","I haven't done any coding before, except some Turbo Pascal and Delphi courses in primary school.

","Java, HTML, CSS","First of all, I would establish a structure of the information in tabs. Then, I would start with a design for the home page, continuing with the structure of the information on each tab.
Then I would move on to design and user experience. Considering it's a creative's portfolio, I would have to come up with some interesting visual triggers. I am also interesting in adding a sort of anonymous like button to each project in order to assess what work was less appreciated, so that I might replace it.
Very important for me would also be the user interface part, because I wish to deliver the best user experience, regardless of the device the portfolio would be viewed.
I guess that's about it.

Speaking of IT, I studied computer science since the beginning of high school. I also participated in the National Olympiad of Informatics, where I obtained in the last 2 years a Silver Medal, which actually means taking approximately the 20th place out of 90 contestants for my grade at that time. In other words, I am pretty accustomed to working with algorithm but, like I said before, I have no experience in real-world coding. I am aware that the skills acquired during my high school years are probably the starting point (for the university and later, a job) but I think it would be good for me to gain some knowledge on other programming languages from now, in order to be able to do what I want to do with code and maybe even work on some applications. I also think that this knowledge could also help me get the most of my working with the computer and also maximize my performance when writing code in C++.","I am a high school student, I am a volunteer",7-10 hours per week,"There are many reasons. To begin with, I want to study computer science as it seems to be what suits me and what I could do my whole life. Speaking about this project particularly, I think it offers a great and unconventional way of studying. Especially in this field, which is always changing, learning from books might turn out to be insufficient. Consequently, learning from someone who knows the best up-to-date technologies is also important and I think, vital. All in all, I think this project can help me gain some technical skills, but also get a more detailed perspective on the underlying developments of this field and how I could manage them, in order to gain the most of my learning in computer science.",Very well,C++,"Taking into account I am at the beginning, I’ve chosen to stick to two basic ideas: fun and education. I am thinking of a game which helps the user learn a foreign language. Why? Firstly, because foreign language are another big passion of mine and secondly, because I think knowing a foreign language is a very valuable skill which is to be more and more desirable in job-seekers, students, etc. I also believe it would be a great way to learn how to write code for graphics but also how to build an application, in general.",Girls Who Code Romania Facebook group,"I’ve done, for the last 4 months, and I am still doing an online internship on a website which aims to give youth a voice. There I have to write an article per week, comment to other articles and communicate with a supervisor. The difficulty I encountered what about the documentation. By what I wrote in those articles I had to present a situation, and the presentation had to be accurate, or to give an opinion, which had to be based on some good facts. On one hand, I ended up reading laws, books and articles in order to document on them, which I didn’t expect to be necessary when I started the project, but I find out new things everyday and this process of looking for information has actually started to grow on me. On the other hand, I got involved in more and more activities in my community, searching for the ability of getting the pulse of my surroundings, of the people around me.","Right now there is a project going on at my high school, in which we have to build a business from scratch. Of course, as we are all 16 or 17 years old, all of it is just on paper and only with an educational purpose, but we learn what the steps are and get a better insight on how it is in real life. However, I am the “manager” – it sounds so big :) - of one of these educational fictive businesses. Each working session, I have to assign tasks to my “co-workers” and to take care of the evolution of our small educational business. We are, of course, also supervised by a teacher which is watching every step we take. But for the experience I have, I think this is the project during which I felt the most that I am in charge.","I haven’t really worked on a project so far. I’m studying computer science in high school, which means I write code in C++. However, for me, this is not enough. We learn especially algorithms, which is great because we learn how to make that “thinking” behind the coding itself. On the other hand, I feel rather insecure when it comes to other skills: for example, if you told me to make an application I wouldn’t know where to start and I also think that in order to write applications efficiently you need to know how to code in several programming languages and choose every time the one that suits best your current situation. I can’t do that either. But if I were to speak about what I actually can do (sorry for the long explanation above but I felt the need to make my situation clear), I learned about instructions, loops, arrays, queues or stacks. For instance, the other day I wrote a code in C++ of the algorithm for finding a Eulerian circle in a graph.","Java, Python, C#, .NET, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP, SQL, jQuery","To start with, let me give a few more details. I imagine my game like this: a menu for choosing a level, and then one for each level (let’s say the levels are A1, A2, B1, B2) where the user could choose a vocabulary/grammar topic. Then he would choose an avatar (from a list of 3 I think). This avatar, which will be a “languager” and also have a name which is related to how it looks: a word from the language the game teaches, adapted to English. Then, this avatar will be placed in a scene where he speaks with somebody. Each scene would have a visual background to suit the situation and they are going to speak, using words or grammar structures that the user wanted to learn. The game would also have subtitles for the scene so that the learner sees how the words are spelled. The new words, when told by the two characters who speak, should be highlighted and a translation should pop up somewhere on the screen, so as the learner sees the new word. These pop-ups should stay until the end of the dialogue, for the learner to see and be aware of the new words. After that, the learner goes into a test, where he is given some question with multiple choice or a gaped text to complete, so as to actually remember the words/grammar he just learned. 
If I was to divide the tasks for the application to be developed , I think the first step would be to choose the information, taking into account how complex the scenes would be for a specific language topic. For as to be accurate and to stay focused on the fact that I’m learning how to write code, I would stick to my mother tongue, Romanian. After developing the application with Romanian language, probably I would add French and German as both are languages that I study. Then, I would build the graphics: the scenes, the avatar. An important thing is that the dialogues the avatar has should be connected with the images, and the images and sound to move/be heard at the same pace as the subtitles. However, if it is too difficult, I think we could just use a background and two static characters, with the sound being heard along with the appearing subtitles. This should take 3/8 of the time for building the project. Last, but not least, I think the skeleton of the application should be built: the menus, the transition, a score/progress remembering tool and also the tests. This last one task I expect to take also 3/8 of the time, while the first task should take 2/8 of the time.
Additional resources are probably just the knowledge I don’t have right now to build this application, and probably some help with its distribution.

It can be really hard (polish grammar is quite complex) but I want to try!",Geek Girls Carrots,"So, thesis - I'm currently building my program and looking for algorithms that make it more and more efficient. It is really important in my case, there is a lot of data to compute.
My job is my first job at all. I started it about 2 years ago and that time I was a complete newbie - I didn't know anything about the technology. First three month were my internship - I was sitting and learning every day, while my friends were having their summer holidays. It was one of the best decisions I ever did - I learned a lot then and started to be interested in programming. During this two years I constantly develop and I really appreciate it. 
Apart from thesis and my job, I had a project on my university concerning building a holter monitor. I wanted to be in software or hardware group in the project and I was really disappointed when the leader assigned me to design group. After some time, it turned out that the leader knew what he was doing. My job included designing interface of program analysing the data and the interface of device.

I had to motivate group, remind them of their work and time limits, organise and plan - it was something like project management. We build a really great group!

I would ask for advice my friends, workmates, people from university - there are a lot of smart people around me. I would talk about what they think apps lack, what would be useful - from the user side.

Next, I would build the ""background"" - project data bases, structure, frameworks - things on which I will work.

This is the moment the programming starts - from the basics and first tools to more and more features. After every stage it should be tested and discussed - people using the apps are most important:)

It would repeat by the time the app reaches all planned stages. While programming and discussing the plan could be modified, of course.

I'm happy to have people do the work they are good at -- in fact in creating artistic projects, collaboration is often necessary to complete.","I recently led a team for NASA Space Apps Challenge NY. After competing previously in my home city of Philadelphia, I learned strategies that were helpful. For instance, having a larger team is definitely an advantage. As soon as the competition went online, I immediately contacted people whose work I admired in wearables, and invited them to participate. They all said yes! We started with a Google group and shared our skills, as well as potential ideas. Then, we allowed for a few new members at the actual competition, and had a great team that was diverse and female heavy. Working together ahead of time enabled us to spend more time on development on site for the competition. Even though the team considered me a leader, I merely let people do what they were good at. If anything, I just laid out a framework of what I thought would help us win -- things like making a website/blog, creating a video, having a fun presentation etc. There was a lot of mutual respect. We also stayed flexible, and although we had our own ideas, after interviewing an astronaut, they drastically changed. We had brought enough parts and supplies to allow this flexibility and it made for a great project. It was basically a wristband called Senti8, which allows an astronaut to have scents injected into the nose which might be missed on earth. It may actually have valid use on earth, and our team is still together pursuing that angle. Needless to say, our group won the NY competition and was one of the top in the international competition. We also earned a separate Honorable Mention for wearables from the Kennedy Space Center. This was a great experiment for me that started with asking complete strangers to join me -- I'm still amazed.","Not really a coder, but I've been able to bring two or three light patterns in C code together for an LED Umbrella in Arduino.

Have me write a short program involving a loop - 4 hours (I really don't know how long it would take me)
Q&A involving programs I see often using NeoPixel LEDs that have algorithms in the way they light up. (Think x+1).

That's as far as I know, without understanding more of the language. I have had a beginner's intro to Python for two days, so I know some terms. However, it's hard for me to take the information in as someone who is coming more from the artist side. At least with Arduino I know where to ask the questions, but I'm happy to learn a lot more about the language. Hopefully a mentor will be quick to spot the areas I need help with. 

As for a mentor, most people that apply to mentor will be similar in me to personality.

One of my first projects was to work on a disciplinary procedure for Germany. Our employer law is very difficult to interpret into everyday work and is totally different form the Spanish system. We wanted to bridge the communiction gap between the spanish team and the stores in Germany, reduce high costs for judicial proceedings (that issues would often esult in due to lack of a good process to deal with them) and increase competence in the store management teams (who were frustrated that the had no support from the HR department) to deal with employer issues. I settled meetings with the concerned departments HR, regional management, training department to inquire about mayor issues, misunderstandings, expectations, possibilities and challenges in execution of disciplinary actions etc.  I wrote the procedure and all paperwork together with the HR department - the spanish team had only limited knowledge and careful communication was needed not to offend them, I then settled ways to enforce it with the regional management  - they are the ones who manage the store teams and would sometimes not adhere to their own rules. So it was a bit of bargaining to establish rules for store teams and get the regional management to subscribe to them aswell. I always prepared 2 solutions for them to chose from -  having the legal essentials in both versions, but giving them the ""decision"". And then I developed a training session in accordance with the training department. and then carried out the trainings for apr. 80 managers. It was a big heap of work but i knew it would be worth it, save a lot of money, time and frustration & result in higher expertise and work satisfaction of management. So I i innitiated the project and convinced all sides of the positive effects. In the end it was launched successfully and is still in place. ","I am not a born leader i have to say. That is why i ended up in training and development i suppose. For me it is important to be convinced of what i am doing & to practice what i preach.

 I have aways found it good to lead people through reason and insight. I tried to highlight the reasons behind and the positive effects, benefits when introducing a new company procedure and asking to change their ""old"" ways and try something new. Understanding the why? is essential to work motivation.

Firstly, I am interested in promoting the idea of women in computing for almost 2 years now. In October 2013, I had the great opportunity to participate in an SAP event in Las Vegas, USA (SAP TechED) which hosted a code jam competition, INNOJam. It happened that the team I was part in was the finalist, and the reward was to present our mobile app at the DEMOJam competition in Las Vegas, in front of 10 000 people, present both physically and online.. DEMOJam is a global SAP competition that promotes the innovative use of SAP HANA (the In-Memory technology powered by SAP). It happened that I was the only woman on stage competing in the DemoJam. The amount of media attention I received after the event made me feel intrigued. Then I understood why the subject of women in computing is so hot in the US and why it is important to promote STEM subjects to women. 

Secondly, being part of a community of women in computing is a great motivator for me as I will soon start my career. While I have various interests, I recently discovered that IT is my greatest passion. I strongly believe that a good professional in the IT industry should have a sound knowledge of programming, and I feel that I need to improve as well. 

I am rather new to coding, and I consider that learning JavaScript from scratch, in an entertaining and gamified environment, surrounded by women motivated by the same goal and part of a global vision about women in computing, is the greatest motivator for me to becoming a good professional. ",Very well,"HTML, CSS","If I were to choose my own language, I think I would choose JavaScript (for now, but JAVA is a very good alternative) and implement an idea of a Creative app that I am having for some time. The basic idea is to help the user in the ideation process.It is a complex application that I want to try to create anyhow with the knowledge I will receive in the next months. I see the idea I have as a good idea for a portfolio, and if I were to find a good team, I would try to start a start up. Also, I am considering to write my master thesis on Creativity support systems, thus using the app to illustrate theory. 

I am open to any suggestions the organizers have. I am here to learn, this is just a personal project.","One of the organizers, Girls Who Code Romania Facebook group, Girls Who Code Romania Facebook page","One of the best experiences I had was when together with 5 other close friends we decided to create PRIME Brasov, the NGO for students studying Communication and Public Relations in Brasov, Romania. We identified that there is a lack in professional practice during the Bachelor's study and we imagined a catalyst NGO for students who want to have practical experience before they enter the market. PRIME Brasov was born after the model of PRIME Romania and originally was designed to be affiliated to PRIME Europe (The European Organization for Students studying Communication and Public Relations). After the disintegration of PRIME Europe, PRIME Brasov was to become an independent organization.

My role in the Board team was one of an adviser, catalyst and I was to help with the other departments when needed. I was the conflict resolution person and also the link with other organization in Brasov, for instance the link to JCI Brasov, or other resources. I was in charge with motivating our team to hold on to the vision and inspire our new members to aim for more.

The greatest challenge was to create a fresh and distinct identity for our newly born organization, with a distinct organizational culture, distinct and functional processes, considering that 5 out of 6 founding members were former AIESEC members. This aspects were vital as we were in search of quality members that were, on the one hand, targeted by AIESEC as well, and on the other hand, eager to assume different organizational roles except members of the PR department so that we ensure the continuity of the organization after we graduate. 

We started as a 6 member organisation and grown to 42 members in only 4 months, training the new members in various areas so that the next generation of 6 board members was successfully born. Being close to graduation, the need of turning over the vital. This next generation defined the identity of the organization and was eager to infuse new ideas so that PRIME Brasov became unique, competitive and a viable option for those eager to have first hand experience during Bachelor's studies. 

I can proudly say that today PRIME Brasov is at its 5th generation of board members, working on projects like the University Television Station, organizing international summer school events together with the University and it is a hub of creativity, with sustainable finances and legal documents. 
","I have leadership experience on and off international and local projects since the second year of bachelor's. I was part for 3 NGOs and a founder of another one, in Brasov, Romania. I took two team leader positions in AIESEC Brasov (approximately one semester for each), one year as the Vice President of PR and Communication in JCI Brasov, one semester in building PRIME Brasov, the Communication and PR NGO for students. I have been part of proactive, confuse, and disfunctional teams, and also being the mediator for team conflicts. 

One of my best leadership experience happened last year in the contest of a university project. It was a 2 and a half day project taking place in Davos, Switzerland, where my classmates and I had to implement a short awareness project about a new solar panels investment that was to be developed nearby Davos. I was the head of Marketing and PR team, and my team was composed of inexperienced international people, so the lack of knowledge of my team was a serious challenge for me as a leader. Due to a series of misunderstandings, the first day of the project was counterproductive and demoralizing for my team. We started fresh the next day, I changed my management style, empowered my people and by the end of the day my team had unexpected comeback. I take proud in the fact that in only one day, we as a team were able to meet 98% of the traditional media target and 80% of the social media target, overcoming the difficulties of lack of knowledge and intercultural challenges.

I chose to illustrate this project as it was the most intense experience I had, the most risky and entertaining and the rewarding. It was a complex carousel of emotions and constant reinventing my strategy, asking for advice, keeping an opened mind and trying to understand the personal agendas and working styles of people coming from different cultures, speaking a different language and having a different educational background than me.","I have studied C# and Pyton in my master's program, but I have never used this knowledge outside the academic space. I was part in a seminar where I used my C# knowledge to develop an app that was awarded with the invitation to the SAP TechEd conference I was talking above, but I can't say that my contribution at that point in time was too technical in terms of programming. I contributed in other areas of project management, research, ideas. 

Since end of February 2014, I am persuing an internship as a front developer for a start-up in Liechtenstein, and I am the only person in charge with the UI for a Big Data and BI tool on Hadoop architecture. I work with CSS3, HTLM5 and JQuery. I have originally used frameworks (bootstrap) but I switched to a framework-free approach.","Java, JavaScript, jQuery","Firstly, I want to say that as a beginner, it is hard for me to make a development plan. I learned just front end development, and I think I need serious reading before being able to come up with a sound architecture and working style. Also, knowing my current level of knowledge, I would approximate an year until the app is functional in the beta version.

This is how I envision my working process, provided I start in 2 weeks from now:

Designing the first prototype with mockups - 1 week
Coding the first version of the screens -  2 weeks
(ongoing learning of JavaScript and architecture mentoring)
Define the backend structure - probably 2 weeks until I find a good plan
Decide the algorithms, and iterations of implementation, testing and debugging - undefined : until I am satisfied with the result.

I decided to start with the UI as I am a visual person, and from my limited experience with the startup I am working with, if the UI is not clear, it is a sign that the concept is not clear.

If I were to make this app happen, I think it would be nice to have another partner to work with. It is really ambitious, but building my own project would be the best motivation of them all.",Liechtenstein,GMT+2,English

Moreover, i would enjoy to learn a new programming language besides C++, SQL, HTML, which I am already studying at school.",Very well,"C++, HTML, CSS, SQL","I don't know exactly what application i would like to implement since i am not familiar with these languages and i consider that i need to know the base of them, so i could think of what i would like to create and improve further, but my purpose would be to create something original, creative and useful, easing people's work.",My computer science teacher,"Regarding the database for the library which I have mentioned above, there were some difficulties we had faced. For example, we had problems when we wanted to implement our ideas. Although we thought about details, when we were to implement them, we were always finding complex solutions for our ideas, but with our teacher help, we understood that we didn't need to complicate ourselves.
To talk about my role in the team, i can say that we were all equal, there was no head. Despite this, we cooperated very well and before taking a decision, we advised together. Also, each of us contributed to every stage of the project, so we could understand all things which are involved in database programming.","It wasn't a certain time when i was a leader, but when i work in a team, my mates tend to ask me things, because i am a perfectionist and i never give a project if i am not pleased witj it. Also, i am focused on details and i believe that these are the ones which truly define a well-done thing.","The last project I worked on was a database for a library. It was homework for school and we had to work in teams. I enjoyed doing it very much, because it was challenging to think about all aspects to consider when we were planning the database and creating the ERDs. Then, after implementing it, i had a sense of fullfilment when we saw that it actually really works. in this way, we were able to see the practicability for what we had learned theoretical for months.
Another project i have worked recently is a HTML page, which was also homework. It is not too sophisticated, but i am pleased with what i have learned, even if this is just the base of HTML.
In addition, i do a lot of C++ programmes, which are also homeworks, as i am going to sustain the 12th grade exam at computer science, but it wasn't any more important.","Java, C#, .NET, JavaScript, PHP","As i mentioned above, i am not sure of what application i would create, but i can say that firstly i would make a plan of what my application's purpose is and then what aspects i need to complete in order to create de application. Furthermore, i would create the base of the appication and afterwards, in case there are not problems while testing it, i would focus on details and improvement which would make the application easier to use and follow. After implementing and testing these too, i would concentrate on the aspect of the application, since it needs to be aesthetic.",Romania,GMT+2,English

I liked a lot that position, because I like to organize things, to give each one of us a part of the project that fits us and let us show our skills and I think that I did it well. Also , at the final of the program, I had to present our project in front of our mentors and the other teams. I liked it very much because I feel comfortable speaking in front of people about things that I am passionate and because I believe that I can summarize very well my team's work and emphasize the essential parts .
","I haven't worked on big projects so far, but one project that I can think of was something that I've done last summer at the Open Source Summer School at my University.  I worked in a team(3 members, including me) on an online store application. The technologies that we used are : Android SDK, Java, Python(all basic). In our team, I've worked with Android and Java on the front-end of our application.","Java, Python, Ruby","First of all, I will need 1-2 weeks to learn the syntax of the programming language chosen and to get comfortable with it.
Secondly,  I will have to divide the project into small tasks, and schedule them on weeks, leaving a week or two free, if I encounter any problems that can affect my schedule.  
Also, I think that I will have to begin with the backend of the application and gradually continue with the frontend, in order to verify if the backend works correctly. 
In order to make it possible, I think that I will need a mentor to guide me and to help me with a good advice when I am really in trouble.

At my school, I intern with the Student Engagement Hubbard Center as a Digital Communications Developer. My job requires  more with front end development. I update and manage web pages and social media accounts, develop visual graphics for Hubbard Center I-Books and website and collaborate with members of staff to develop and enhance the website. ","I am a bachelor student, I am working on at least a project",3-5 hours per week,"I want to continue increasing my knowledge and skills in the field of Computer Science. I view this discipline not so much as something that will give me a job, but rather a major that gives me the ability to make impacts on my world, by developing solutions to ongoing problems. For instance, before there was a filter, it was more difficult to purify water or before the internet, information was mainly available to only a select amount of people.  From my point of view, my skills should be my main qualifier, but being a black woman in the field of CS reminds me constantly of the fact that I am viewed as a double minority. That being said, I go beyond the work just assigned in classes, and use resources like Degreed, Code Academy, and Udacity to increase my knowledge.This serves as fuel for me to want to strive for better, and the opportunity to become a scholar would undoubtedly give me the resources and mentorship needed to help myself  along with other young women that have similar struggles. This move in a progressive direction simply starts with me showing up and working in the field of CS, because for far too long we have heard that women are not the ideal students and that we can not be successful in Computer Science.  ",Very well,"C++, Java, HTML, CSS","I would like to understand Swift because I use X-Code a lot and would like to be able to make functioning apps using Swift. I wanted to make my own version of Flappy Bird, because I was one of the people who never got to download it before it was removed.","A friend, GHC 2014, Systers"," At my school I am apart of a club that promotes cultural education and women issues. In honor of breast cancer survivors and patients we held two events a commemoration with candle vigil and presentation educating other people about breast cancer and then a few days after we held a training session that showed both women and men the way to do a self breast examination. My role was to help teach our female attendees how to do the examination while my partner focused on the males. Engaging women in these activities are easier than engaging men, so it took researching to show men stats that prove that men can also be diagnosed with breast cancer. The other challenge was maintaining an orderly group. To do so I split the attendees into 4-5 groups to ensure that I wasn't training a large group all at once and risking losing their attention. Overall, I deem it successful because afterwards the attendees were able to show how to do the examination on mannequins. Raising awareness and educating others is a key step in ensuring that diseases like breast cancer can be detected early and properly dealt with. ","Leading is not an easy feat and there are times that leaders are called to go above and beyond. As the president of my Debate team, I am in charge of ensuring the well being of the team and ensuring we gets proper representation in Student Gov. forums. Recently, the attendace has been less than par. The student assigned in charge of recruiting and promotions is a constantly busy senior, which leads to this key aspect of building our team being neglected. It would have been easier to give the student a hard time, to distance myself from responsibility, but that would not have solved our recruitment problem. I instead spoke to the student about considering abdicating his duties if they were too overwhelming. Although, discussing something like this was hard, it help to find out that for the past few weeks he was just in a bind for time. I worked out that I would handle the emails for a certain amount of time and personally talk to specific students that we would like to see on our team. The recruitment is still below what we would like it to be, but it has increased and brought new and prospective members to the our practices. For now, it is back to the drawing board to come up with other strategies that will increase attendance or figure out if the club should change our meeting times. It is imperative as a leader to be the leader that can do multiple jobs, even if those jobs are not your direct responsibility.  
","My most recent project was working on building two simple apps using Youtube directions from MatHeaney Apps. The first app was a calculator and the second was a timer. The apps both compiled and the calculator runs well, but the timer has a bug that I am working on fixing. The calculator was made in Objective-C but the timer was made using Swift (X-Code) so I beleive that is another reason for the bug.
X-Code found an exception to a declaration that I made for the start button so when the user hits start, it crashes.

The most current project I am working on is creating a Music Festival app using knowledge from an Intro to App Development Udacity course. Using Sales Force, I have been able to create the objects needed and I am now working on specifying the fields. For instance, the capacity and the amount of tickets that will be sold.

Another application I would like to develop is a Digital Library, which can actually organize and edit the e-books, articles and the information found on internet. The reason why I want to make it is because there is so much information available nowadays, that without filtering and organizing it, it is difficult to process and analyze it. ",Girls Who Code Romania Facebook page,"During my first year of masters I was working in a project for creating and publishing textbooks of Learning Romanian Language as Second Language. My task in this project was to elaborate one unit of the textbook for B1-B2 level. The requirement was to follow the standard rules and methodology given, to keep it organized, while making it attractive an interactive.
The difficulty of the task consisted in creating the audio exercises, finding or making clear and relevant visual exercises, but also in making the evaluation test.
The section that took a lot of my time and which I had to remake was the reading fragment. I was supposed to choose an article, news, magazine etc. and to simplify the complexity of the sentence and the vocabulary to the B1 level. It seems easy, but it is not.
In order to understand how to do that, I started tutoring the foreign students who were learning Romanian. I was surprised to find out that what we find to be the most basic aspects of the Romanian language for them it was something very difficult to understand and to assimilate.
From that project I learnt that in order to understand something new, you have to look at it from a different perspective.","During High School, and then during my Bachelor's I was the head student in my class.

I was collaborating with the professors, the secretary and the dean of the faculty and thus keeping my classmates up to date with the latest announcements. All the important events were decided and divided among a group of students, each with the task of covering a certain aspect or the event. I was making sure that in case one student was not able to fill his/her part, another one will take over that task.
A typical event is signing the annual study contract with the faculty. I was constantly getting informed about the time when the contracts were going to be released and once I was receiving them, I was spreading them among classmates, by giving them to at least one student from a group of friends. I was contacting the missing students and updating the info on the class Facebook group. I am a persisting person, so I was making sure that I am getting and submitting all the contracts before the deadline. I believe that being a leader means being responsible, while supporting others in fulfilling the tasks they are good at or helping and distributing the task on which they are encountering difficulties.","I studied Humanities and Linguistics, but I always felt that is time to integrate my field in the Digitized Platform.

The theme was multiculturalism and I found it hard to represent such an abstract term in a poster, without making it look too tacky, plus my design skills weren't very good... I asked my team leader for help, and together with her I finished the design.","Whenever my friends and I decide to go somewhere out of town I volunteer to make all the necessary plans.

I planned the trip, checked the highway news for anything that might interest us, booked the hotel rooms in Sibiu and let my uncle know that we will be visiting him in Brasov.

Discuss the future technical steps with my mentor. Set 2 goals like> make it look good, make it work (website).
Start doing the actual work with deadlines for each step.
Learn how to use a program like Dreamweaver of something similar so as if I ever try to turn this passion in a business I will work like a pro...or something similar :).
Plan future steps for the project like creating an app or linking the website to another type of site.

I'm fairly confident that I will learn coding pretty fast but then again I know nothing...I can't plan a schedule but I'm sure that 1-2 hours a day and perhaps 2-3 in the weekend will get me great results.

Challenges:
- the deadlines were not clearly communicated by the business and they kept on changing according to the customer's needs
 - the estimations often needed adjustments
 - the platform lacked unit testing and the features were poorly documented

Solutions:
 - we requested a firm Due date for each release which we also included in our issue tracker, at a ticket level
 - we started to add a buffer amount of time to our estimate (in case we finished earlier, we used the extra time to test the functionality)
 - we implemented unit testing for the big features
 - we repeatedly requested documentation from the customer and emphasized the importance of having at least the major functionalities well documented and we also started documenting the code

At the end the customer was happy and we all learned a lot from this experience. ","I love working with people. :)

I managed about 7 different teams by now and I believe communication active listening a solution oriented approach and kept promises are the main ingredients for a successful project, since they all lead towards trust.

And you need to trust your team and they need to trust you back, in order to build and deliver something according to customer's needs and keep the positive atmosphere while doing that. And of course there will be good times and bad times, pressure and relaxation, laugher and chaos, tight deadlines and storytelling evenings, but at the end of the day we all need to learn something from each other. We all have something to share and something to teach. 

Everyone wants to do his / her best, it's just that you have to find a way to reach that in each and every person and motivate them so that they keep on growing, keep their eyes on the project goals and their mind open to the endless possibilities of implementation so that you find the best approach at that given moment.

So I try to do this by celebrating small wins of each individual because if the persons in your team don't work, your project is already gone. Projects are just like people, temporary and unique. :)

Using Zebrabox and Open CV I had to analyse the movements of zebrafish in response to various visual stimuli. Also, I used confocal microscopy to determine the activity of the zebrafish brain in response to light and dark. Working in research required a lot of patience. I did not know how to use the Zebrabox and Open CV and I had to constantly collaborate and communicate with the Phd student who advised me what is better to do. Moreover, I had to learn for the first time to use the confocal microscopy. For this, I read online papers that gave me an insight into confocal microscopy while the supervisor of the project constantly gave me feedback on my work.","Four years ago, enthusiastic and hopeful, I founded Student’s Psychiatry Scientific Association in Cluj-Napoca, the first Romanian Students’ Society in its field. Two medical colleagues followed me in implementing my idea. Together we gained the support of Ioana Miclutea, doctor in psychiatry and peer-review at European Psychiatry Journal. We developed a plan, whose main objectives were to weekly gather medical students at speeches and debates on mental health, increase student’s access to psychiatry research and, eventually, place students in internship positions at the Psychiatry Clinic. Our plan was approved by the University of Medicine Council. Still, the university did not offer us financial support. Consequently, we involved in fundraising, an extraordinary opportunity to improve our persuasive communication skills and relationship-building abilities. Indeed, we succeeded in receiving the necessary sum of 1000€ from Hiperdia Imagistic Clinic just to set up the society. 
The Psychiatry Association was a real accomplishment. We strongly  promoted it on websites and hospitals halls and in three month we had 100 active members. We succeeded in enhancing student’s awareness of mental disorders, as proven through monthly assessments. Still, the greatest achievement was the collaboration with Sergiu Pasca, a remarkable researcher from Stanford University, who gave talks on autism and performed practical demonstrations on neuronal cell culture. Some of the members of Psychiatry Association were inspired by Pasca’s example and got involved in researching genetic factors of anxiety disorders at Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory, Cluj-Napoca.
The Psychiatry Scientific Association experience taught me the importance of setting a clear goal and having the courage to fiercely believe in it. I learnt that any achievement asks for patience, commitment and thorough organization. Most importantly, every success is not only yours, but shared with all those who trusted your passionate dream and offered their energy and knowledge to make it come true. This endeavour grants me confidence that any genuine effort is not fruitless and legitimacy that I should follow my greater aspiration: to bring change in the Romanian Healthcare System.

I had a huge fear of public speaking and really didn't want to compeer. But there was no other person. So I prepared the compeer script and practised. Still I was nervous and about to give up. But I managed through it and it was one of the biggest breakthroughs I had!

The next biggest challenge was teamwork. I had to work with students outside my faculty, mostly guys, whom I had never worked before, on a girls only event!!!

I asked them to do a presentation to help them improve their public speaking skills.

Then, how about we save energy at the same time?” The approving faces of my audience boosted my confidence and increased my excitement to share my idea with the crowd.
 
As team leader of my group in the ArtScience Prize, I led my group in project responding to the theme, “Energy of the Future.” After brainstorming how to solve the world’s energy problems, we concluded that the as the world energy supply is depleting, it is wasting more and more energy. Since most people are unwilling to change their daily habits to save energy, we created an incentive system based on money to conserve consumption. And we called it Energy Bank: a mobile app that promotes energy conservation awareness and helps users to reduce their electricity monthly bills. While developing Energy Bank, I more about electricity companies, mobile app programming, the online “cloud,” and even marketing. Working with mentors and presenting to professionals, I enhanced my communication skills and learned about marketing strategies.

After six months of preparation, the big day awaited. At the Discovery Science Center, we competed for the ArtScience Prize. Speaking to a panel of five judges, I felt like an entrepreneur on Shark Tank asking the “sharks” for investment. The judges provided both applaud and criticism. Although their demeaning remarks stung, I knew my team had done our best. The moment the director of the ArtScience Prize announced the winners, words couldn’t describe my joy.

The ArtScience Prize changed my life. It inspired me that I could initiate action to create anything into reality. I had the potential to change the world.

The most challenging aspects of working towards the Prize was the initial step of brainstorming an idea. Because we needed to create something powerful and impactful to society, it took months just to think of an idea and stick to it. After we established a basis, things started to easily move forward.","I remember back in 6th grade, my band director informed us that the school will be cutting funds to support music education. That following year, my school district discontinued the elementary music program due to a lack of student enrollment. Fortunately, I was able to continue the clarinet in high school. As I continued my lessons with my clarinet teacher, we decided to form a clarinet choir called ‘Voices of the Wind.’ Consisting of eight members, we performed at local hospitals to find an audience. Soon enough, when we realized that more and more middle schools were discontinuing their music programs, especially in poor neighborhoods, I knew we had to do something about it. It was unfortunate to see that at such a critical age, when students begin to develop their musical gifts, the opportunity was taken away. 

We named our project “Let’s Play Clarinet.” The mission was to provide free clarinet lessons to children who did not have access to musical programs. For three months, we contacted community centers, music stores, and newspapers for sponsors and donations.  We were fortunate to receive seven clarinets, ten music stands, and even money to purchase other materials. We also contacted repair stores and requested time donations to fix some damaged clarinet pieces. After gathering all the materials, we were able to hold classes at the El Salvador Community Center in Santa Ana, where neighboring many elementary schools that did not have school music programs. I planned a 16-week course with a concert to close the program. We played the theme songs of Star Wars and Indiana Jones, which they thoroughly enjoyed. On the last day of the program, I was shocked by what I had created - six smiling faces who performed a great show for their family and friends. Sixteen weeks ago, they had no idea what a clarinet was but now they were creating music for the first time in their lives. ","My most recent programming project was last year. Using a Scribbler Robot and an Arduino kit, I programmed a robot with a crane that sensed trash nearby, picked it up, and threw it away in a designated area.

The reason why I would like to implement such an application is a personal one. My father just left my mother recently on short notice. They are in there 50s and my mom suffers a lot since their break-up. Because of their break-up I got to know that divorce is a big topic for people in their 50s and that many people in this age deal with similar problems and fears.

2) Decide and match the final team, which works on the creation.
3) After deciding on the main functions we should probably decide a bit on the design and do some drafts how the website/ the app will look like.
4) Divide labour, who programs which part of the application. Furthermore we should decide together on a timeline and on how we give each other regular feedback on the process itself and the creation of the application.
5) Now the real work begins, the programming, the creation of the app.

",I am a PhD student,More than 10 hours per week,"Friends of mine who are computer programmers always says ""there is nothing more exacting than the view of compiling script without errors"". I would like to experience that feeling ;-). However, the main reason is the awareness that I will have opportunity to acquire skills to programmed codes which can help i.e. in the detection of mutations responsible for cancer. When I think about that I just can`t wait when I will start my adventure with programming!.
I am a biology graduate of the Jagiellonian University. Last 3 years I worked as a scientist in a Medical University of Warsaw in Poland, currently I am a PhD student at the same University. I present a high level of biological and medical academic knowledge. However, I don`t present any programming experience. For a longer time I wanted to try learning programming to connect acquired programming knowledge with my biological and medical experience in the future. When I came across to your program “ learn IT, girl” I thought that this is a great opportunity to gain initial skills that will be usefull in my future career as bioinformatics
",Good enough,I do not know any programming language,"I would like to be a bioinformatics in the future. When I read about skills which I should acquire in coding, the most important for this branch is coding in Java, SQL i C/C++/C# and Parl. After reading some information of these programming languages I would choose Java or C#. 
What kind of application would  I  like to implement and why?
Application that will contribute to the implementation of new information/point of view in the current state of medical knowledge. An example would be an application that will help in detection of mutations responsible for cancer or other civilization disease. That's why I became a biologist/scientist, I wanted to contribute to the implementation of something new to modern medical knowledge.

",A friend,"Most sticks in my mind the end of the project: ""A new method of predicting the ability of osteoconductive and osteoinductive implantable ceramic materials”. The reason why was certainly my role in the project. First time I perform the functions of the person how was responsible for the whole biological part of the project. The biggest challenge was the time. It was`t possible to write the end report, without the completion of all biological experiments which were based on in vitro cell culture. While you can influence people`s activation and their work, influence on the condition of the cells are much harder. Therefore, the time that left to write the final report was significantly reduced.  The key of success was adequate separation of tasks, assign tasks to the appropriate people and adequate planning time. After that experience I'm aware that I'm not afraid of confronting problems and have skills of solving them – probably, thanks to my science experience strongly connect with analytical and logical thinking, as well as my interpersonal skills.","It will be the same situation as above. 
Working as a researcher allowed me to gain good organization skills as well as ability to handle multiple tasks. Managing courses allowed me to broaden this knowledge. I finished:

1)	“Managing an organization”, 80 hours,  Jagiellonian University; main topics: 
•	teambuilding, 
•	leading and coordinating a team, 
•	motivation and effectiveness, 
•	personal skills, 
•	problem solving

2)	“Animator of innovations”, 92 hours, Rzeszow Regional Development Agency ; 
•	Leading and coordinating a team,
•	research and innovation management,
•	finance for innovation,
•	commercialization of innovation research,
•	intellectual property management and protection, 
•	Practical part (a three-day course in Belgium): exchanging best practices from abroad; getting acquainted with examples of supporting innovation in science in Belgium.

Moreover I really enjoy and I am capable of working with people. 
Working in a Public Relations Agency (during the study) allowed me to gain skills cooperating effectively with clients. The international internship (six months in Leibniz University of Neurobiology in Germany) allowed me to good ability to adapt to multicultural environments. Working as a researcher taught me to public presentation of the research data at national and international conferences and running open discussion. Cooperate with different researcher groups, PhD as well as teaching students gave me a sense I am easily establishes contacts with people and I appreciate a good atmosphere at work.","I`m an absolute beginner in coding, in point of fact, I do not have any knowledge of coding. However, I have already registered for the course “Introduction to Computer Science”on EDX website, which offers interactive online classes and MOOCs from the world’s best universities. This course is a Harvard College's introduction to the programming for majors and non-majors alike, with or without prior programming experience. Unfortunately I just started this course so I can`t boast of participation in the project(s) or homework connect with programming. 
As a biologist, I participated in several large projects, assuming various functions. However, working in scientist taught me to plan, perform and analyze experiments/projects as well as coordinating and monitoring work of me and my coworkers. I am also mastering new things quickly and with pleasure. Scientist positions taught me to preparation of standard operating procedures, preparation of the project proposal, reports or scientific publications which, I am strongly convinced, will be of great introduction to participate in IT projects.

From that I learned that if i really have the need I can do anything. 

Although I didn't involve in making the robot I had a good idea of every step of the process. I knew every part and what is it doing there. This knowledge helped me to write the project report very well. Most of the projects in university is measured on its project report. Even if the product does not worked properly,  

","We once held an event called ""Internship Reflections"" I was the co-chair of the event. It is about how different IT companies handle their internships. When this idea was brought forward we understood that there is some kind of risk involved. We were not sure if the companies can be bought to a single platform and talks about their internships and training procedures for interns. It's not like they present it to the students. They have to share it with other company representatives as well. But hoping for best we started to register for companies.

For that I thought rather than sending a mail if we go and talk to them we would get a better response. So we make a team and went to IT companies ourselves and talk to them. We were happy that most of the companies listened to us and presented their worries. But at the end of the day we were able to persuade majority of the companies to participate in the event. 

Since this is done we then had only to proceed to making the place arrangements, publicity and so on. Those are the easy stuff since we have our presenters ready.

Overall this was a very successful event and both the students and the companies asked us to make this a tradition and annual event.","I have worked on a programming android app for automating location based services. The app will automatically let you change your device's settings once you reach a certain location. For example when you go to the lecture hall, your phone will get silent.

Since this is an mobile app, my major focus was given to the user interface. User will be able to select a location and set of settings such that when the user get to that location, the setting you selected will be automatically get activated. The location is defined as a pair of geo coordinates and a radius. But practically users do not know the geo coordinates of a certain place. therefore I used Google maps API. From that users are given a map where you can select a location from the map and add the radius manually. 

The location and settings are considered as a single profile and saved in the local memory by serializing it. The underlying service is used to detect locations and match them with a cached list of saved profiles' locations. When a match is found then the particular profile is deserialized from the memory and the settings get activated.","C#, Ruby, Objective-C (iOS), jQuery","1. Designing phase.

The biggest challenge I had faced was to find a compromise between the tools' technical requirements, corporate norms in terms of quality and data completeness and the shortage in personnel and time available to go through the evaluation of each local document, so that it would have an accurate status.
After having met separately with each party to understand the status and their point of view (IT, corporate QS, local quality leaders) I have arranged a common meeting to make a statement abut the tool requirements from CMS perspective, where compromise be accepted and where not, and what were the main problems faced so far. Each party has presented it's perspective. After the meeting I had worked with Corporate QS to develop the next steps and decisions to be followed by everyone.

It was challenging because it was the first time I had to act as a leader, and manage a team of 6 people, take care of a group of 40 teenagers and make sure everything is in order for the 4 international students we brought in to teach.

Even though we had a lot of hiccups along the way (the promo that we did in schools wasn't enough at that time, we had troubles with hosting our 4 internationals etc) the overall feeling and the outcome of the project was incredible.

To see teenage kids being able to get up on a stage in front of their parents, teachers and friends, and give a speech, to see them gain confidence and have a bit of clarity for their own future, was more than I could ask for.

As a result of the success of the project: 2 of the 10-graders at the time joined AIESEC (one is now Vice President), others have started their own educational projects while others opted to stretch out their limits and go for scholarships abroad; From my project team, 2 members applied and got accepted to being a Vice President for AIESEC in the same term I was (one of them later on became on of my best friend :) )
","During my 3 years in AIESEC, I had 3 different roles: team-member in an ecological project for students (2 other members + team leader), team leader in an educational project for high-school students (managing a team of 6 members) and Vice President of the Projects department for a year (with 6 other Executive Board members; managing about 20 projects and their team leaders in a year)

Since I already gave some details about GROW, I will only say that beside my actual work experience & traveling experience, that year of being VP in AIESEC has definitely been the most challenging and rewarding one so far. Leading an organization of about 100 students id not easy, but I'm glad I got to be part of it and leave my mark behind :)","Just a small website in HTML in the 9th grade, and some classes with CodeAcademy.

Step 2. Planning - make the time frame for your project, figure out what kind of resources you need and where to place them
Step 3. Design - Either built it from scratch or get someone to do it for you. Start off with basic Photoshop skills and work your way to to knowing how to format your app, what font you want to use, color pallet and elements too. Make a final design then go to
Step 4. Development - start working the back-end version for your app (web dev - no idea if there's back-end in mobile (yet) ) then move up to your front-end version
Step 5. QA - test your app and figure out what works and what needs fixing
Step 6. Bug fixing and changes - fix your issues and implement the latest changes you wish to have for your app
Step 7. Finishing & evaluating your app - does it meet the requirements you first envisioned at step 1? Does it work, is it functional, could it be used by your targeted audience, what's the actual feedback received?

We coded this back in 2013 - my first few months of programming when I was a first year- and it basically emulates NFC cards, barcode/QR loyalty cards to allow seamless payment without having to carry your cards around.

 I talked to all the team members and asked them what they were most interested and confident in and we decided on roles through that process - working on GUI, working on the NFC reader etc. I made sure the team was communicating every hour - listing goals, progress, errors etc so we could keep track of our progress. I made sure we kept merging and compiling our code every now and then. The biggest problem I faced was keeping up the team spirit as we were coding for 28 hours straight. I made sure the coding was more of a social activity than a chore with several breaks and chats in between. If a team member looked tired I would tell them to take a break and also, I would praise them for their work! We managed to complete our app and we were really proud of our project.

Our group seemed to be one of the quieter/shy ones and after our proposal task was assigned, no one seemed to be arranging meetings or anything. I thought that someone needed to take a stand and lead this group. So I started organising frequent meetups in the library, listening and talking with the members and seeing what they had to say about certain things, giving them the confidence to speak and praising them when they spoke etc. We managed to write our proposal and then practise for our proposal pitch which went really well!

2) huge blunders were done in database which was noticed at the end of almost 85% of coding.(it was very disappointing) we made changes in entire database and changed the coding again) we have learned a lot from these mistakes.

3) also the requirements were changing quite frequently from the company for whom we were working. (either they ask us to remove the entire thing on which we have worked for so many days, or they will add new thing to include in the system) but we worked accordingly and submitted a project with which they are satisfied today. 

tutorials available on net were the biggest reason of this accomplishment! :)","only during a time of this project i was quite active but i havent acted as a leader in any IT related events.
Apart from IT events, i have been a leader or i can say, i have managed one musical event in my university. (i am a very fond of music)","recently made a web application for a reputed blood bank in asp.net using c#.
brief description:-
~Application that can be helpful for Donors and Patients to come together and send their requirements online. With this application I have tried to develop a platform where donors don’t need to go personally for an appointment for blood donation as it is quite time consuming, and instead he can check online that whether he is eligible to donate or not.(he has to fill an eligiblity check form) system will check his eligibility. and if he is eligible, date and time will be provided to him as an appointment.
~ Also if patient needs blood then he can fill his requirements online to the blood bank. or any relative or his friend can send request for him on his behalf.

Detailed info:

This system will be basically used by: 
1) Users
2)  Administrator
3) Visitors
Their roles in the system are specified below:
1)User:-
As a user, this application is very much helpful. Users will be able to register themselves and create profile. They can edit their profile. He will be asked to choose an option from 2 categories:-
i)Want to donate blood? 
Once he choose the option to donate blood, certain eligibility criteria related to blood donation will be asked to the user. Thus his eligibility will be checked by the system.
If he is eligible to donate blood, he will be asked that whether he wants to donate 
a) Once? Or
b) Regularly to any thalassemia patient?(~ There are many thalassemia patients whom this blood bank provides blood on regular intervals.)

        If he chooses the option to donate regularly, a list of all thalassemia patients will be displayed. He can choose any one from the list to donate regularly. He can also skip the option if he doesn’t wants to donate to that patient again.
 
After every 3 months (if a donor is male) or 4 months(for females) a notification will be displayed on donor’s wall.
If a donor has accepted to donate blood and if he doesn’t appears to donate then Reminder will be displayed to him.

ii))Is in need of a blood?
If a user is in need of blood, there might be a possibility that he is requesting blood on behalf of some other patient. So in that sense an alternate mobile no and blood group will be asked again.
User will fill data and an entry will be made on patient’s table.  A message will be sent to blood bank that this user is in need of mentioned blood group.
Blood bank will contact to the patient immediately.(they have their call center)

After login news of upcoming events and information of drives will be available to the user. If he wants to check about location of the drives for a particular date, then he can choose a date from the calendar available in the sidebar.



2)Administrator:-
Administrator is a person who is responsible for maintaining data into database. Administrator will be authenticating the users during registration. 
Admin will manage the blog.
In blog, all registered users can write an article. (eg: why one should donate blood?, how blood donation saved their lives?..)  Other users (registered as well as visitors) can view these articles on blog but only registered users can comment on those articles. Visitors won’t be given such rights. 
Once any new article or comment is posted by any user, it will be checked by admin. If admin approves them then only it will be visible on the website for other user. Admin can delete the garbage data. But he cannot insert or update the information in blogs. 
 Any registered user can share his experience of the application and can give suggestions through feedback or by writing an article. 

Administrator can delete personal profile of any user or can insert a new user when required to be changed explicitly. 

Admin will store the data of drives and can edit, update and delete this information.

This information will be displayed with the help of google maps.
Google maps locating drives will be displayed on user’s wall after login. Calendar will be shown to user, if he wants to check the location of drives for a particular date.
Admin will be also responsible to update news in the database. He can perform insert, update, delete and view on it. 
He will be also given rights to view the available total stock of different blood groups, and he can accordingly generate alerts if necessary.
At frequent intervals he will ask questions which will be answered by registered users through votes. He can also insert, update and delete the poll questions.

around 30 kinds of reports admin can generate as per the requirments.

3)Visitor:-
Visitor will be able to view only the information stored about blood. Visitor does not need to login/register to view the visitor pages. Information related to upcoming events and drives will not be available to a visitor. Visitor can view the articles on blog. But he can won’t be allowed to comment or rate any article.

This project was submitted to the company and a good feedback certificate was received.

The main problem with studying a business-related subject is that it doesn’t leave much room for creativity - and this matter has been really bothering be for the last two years, as I’ve always been interested above all in creating things.

I got interested in IT very recently and the thing that enchanted me in the first place was the culture of sharing and mutual support which seems to be the characteristic of the coders’ community. And most importantly - they create things!

Although at first I thought one needs to be some kind of a genius to work in computer science, after reading a bit about the topic and meeting a few self-taught programmers who work in the field of IT, I finally believed that it might be possible for me as well to become a coder. And - as programming seems to be the alphabet of the future - one day I would love to share the knowledge with others by conducting workshops or trainings, especially for young people.

That’s why now I want to learn as much I can to fulfil this dream.",Very well,I do not know any programming language,"Since I’m a total novice I’m not really aware yet of all the possibilities of different languages.

I also like to write a few words about the driver, because they’re always interesting people.

Guiding fellow actors (aka my classmates), maintaining discipline at rehearsals and trying to pay attention to details but also keep track of the big picture - it all required a lot of effort, but it allowed me to overcome shyness and learn new skills.

I had many challenges, which always began the same way: getting people to show up. Then, the debate itself was very difficult to contain in a decent format since most of the police officers and inspectors immediately felt attacked when topics such as police brutality, excessive use of force, inhumane treatment and such engaged them to raise up their defense mechanisms. So instead of lawyers, I got them to talk to people from the community. Instead of using bad examples, I focused on the positive ones where police were actually helping the sex workers and protecting them.

So I stepped up, pushed the best idea to the point where it had to be executed, managed to motivate everyone to participate, and even though they were pretty skeptical, there was a great turnout of random people, which was basically the point, to reach common people and not the same 100 people from the NGO sector, and it was a great success.

It was a very hard time of working on a few projects in a very limited period of time (simultaneously it was a great time spending with the best people in the world :)). The challenge was that every single person from our group was from completely different place of the world and also from different culture. It turned out that we had different ideas of how to work, so the first thing we had to do was discuss and explain the process of work and the role of single person in the group. We had to trust each other that everyone manages his/her task because it was no time for checking others work. We worked under the pressure of time and then our work was presented in front of the international experts. Every day we had to do the part of the main project and presented it. Of course - there happened a situation that we had to present not very complete project with the stressful thought that the expert would be listen to this.. And the best thing in this situation was the feeling that you're not alone in front of the audience and have the support of all of the people from your group. So the best thing I've learned was international teamworking, good organizing the work in very limited time and coping with stress. ","I will mention the same time of the international summer school as in my previous story. As I wrote above we conducted a few little projects to complete the bigger one. So that every day we chose a leader of 'work for today'. The leader had to define present priorities and share the responsibilities. He/she also presented the results of the work in front of the expert. The funny thing of my being a leader was that I had been chosen to this position when we had to work on the topic that I had no idea about.. But I got a great support from my group. As a leader I not only gave the instructions to my team, but also I collected they work to make the presentation. Every person from my group prepared his/her part of the project professionally but with little comments only for me as for completely 'freshman' in this topic. It lets me be a good and representative leader of my group. I also managed to answer the questions of the expert.

The most 'IT project' is the project of blog that I'm working on with my two friends. They asked me to think about nice graphic design and to provide some content about psychology of design. This is the very beginning of our work - I learn the Sketchbook and use my tablet and developing my knowledge about UX and design (eg. by participating in UX or IT events in Krakow and reading a lot).

1. I need to get better in html/css 
2. Learn JavaScript (I will do this in 3 months!)
3. Develop my graphic skills.
How to do this?
I will try to spend about 1h for training my code skills. I know that not every day I could have this 1h of free time, so the plan B is to spend at least 15 free minutes per day (every day) to exercise and to have everyday contact with coding. (I know that this is possible from my experiences when I have been learning with codecademy course).The other idea is to start working on my own project very soon to learn on my own material - I think that this let me engage in my work and will motivate me to spend on it more time. I will also use my tablet every day to train - I actually do this nowadays, but I should make more useful graphics for my project.
Simultaneously while learning to code I also should do some research of what content should my application contain. I will base on scientific knowledge of cognitive and neuropsychological processes and also I will conduct the research of basic expectations regarding this kind of program among the patients. 
The important part of my work will be also make it user-friendly - so that I should develop my UX knowledge. It will be the specific user with his/her own needs and expectations - I should take it into account.",Poland,GMT+1,English

10/22/2014 0:30:05,,Ryniak,Katarzyna,Female,Poland,katarzynaryniak@gmail.com,I'm just learning to code,"I am on 4th year of psychology specialising in Organizational Psychology. Moreover, I am a soft-skills trainer and a coach in training.","I am a Master student, I am working part-time",3-5 hours per week,"First and foremost, I consider learning how to code as a challenge I want to take and new field to discover. I am a psychology student, trainer and a recruiter in IT. I do quite a lot but hopefully I'm in the position of enjoying everything I do and taking as much as I can learn from it.

When I started to work in IT I got to know a lot of developers and got closer to IT community. From that moment a whole new world opened for me! To be honest, I used to have this stereotype of programmers being all isolated from outside world. But the reality turned out to be completely different and exciting! I was lucky enough to get to know people who inspired me and hooked me on the concept of programming even though before that moment I had no experience with code at all. 

Ever since I was a kid I was attracted to new technologies. I have no idea how did it happen that I haven't got to know coding before. When I finally become aware how exactly programmes, apps and websites are built I was already focused a lot on my psychology studies and decided to postpone learning how to code to ""undefined future"". So the year were passing by but finally I got to work with programmers on daily basis and... BUM! The desire of learning how to code came back. Twice as intense as it used to be in the past. I started to read books and to do some online courses of HTML. I started to ask questions but even though there were programmers in my work environment there was no one to answer and to guide me around technologies. As I am kineastethic learner I needed interactions to acquire knowledge.
 
I still have got no idea what to do with coding and which way to go. I feel it would be great to combine both my background in psychology and programming skills that I really would like to acquire. Right now I am digging deeper into UX and UI as I consider them the closest thing to human-technology interaction. But I have got no idea what to do, what to learn and where to go from that point on. 

Taking part in ""Learn IT, Girl!"" would be a huge chance for me to get closer to technology and take challenge of learning how to code. Technology is great and I am very happy that more and more people (especially girls!) are getting involve in it. I truly support the idea of the project and it's goals. I would love to cooperate with mentor, as I mentioned I value having a person how would be there to guide and answer questions. 

I am fully aware of the time that need to be put in the project for fulfilling it. And I am willing to take this opportunity to develop myself, cooperate with mentor and get to know the community better. I really want to learn IT.",Very well,I do not know any programming language,"Oh! Love this question! 
I would love to implement an application that would help people to find events happening around in which they can potentially be interested in taking part. Right now, I am spending a long time browsing Facebook, Meet-Ups and other websites in order to check what's going on and what are the things that are going on. 

An app like that can suggest you events, inform whether sign-up is required and add those events to your calendar. You also will be able to choose what area you are interested in. No matter if it's IT, psychology or theatre. You will get the notification with all of the details.",Geek Girls Carrots,"The project I would like to tell you about is definitely not IT related as before now I had no experience with IT. But I am a trainer and for the last couple of years I a have been working in ""Zero Generation"" which is NGO focusing on helping youth to develop leadership skills. The biggest project I was working on was a Leadership Summer School. It's a 10-days long training programme dedicated for young entrepreneurs, students, community leaders and other NGOs workers. I was a member of Trainers' Team. 

The biggest challenge was to work in a team of 14 trainers and coordinate a whole event for 80 participants. We were all responsible for designing a content, creating the flow, delivering all of the trainings and the most important - taking care of the participants and their learning process. It was hard but one of the most valuable experience of my life. Something I took for myself was definitely a experience of working in a big team and dealing with own and others' frustration or tiredness. Moreover, during those two weeks I have learned that failure is not a situation to be afraid of but on the contrary - a learning experience. 

The whole preparation to the event lasted for more than 4 months so I also experienced a lot of remote-work, working in cross-cultural team and, because of the size of the team, working with different types of people. It was a priceless experience.","When I was a pupil in school I loved group projects. I was always so much looking forward to teamwork. My approach haven't changed much during the years and I still enjoy working in a group. 
One of the times I remember most was during preparation to one of the projects on the university. It's neither the biggest nor the most successful project but I personally appreciate this a lot.

It was the end of the academic year, a lot of studying to be done, a lot of projects to end. There was this one project I really care about. However, my team mates had slightly different approach. They didn't want to spend time on subject that they were not interested it. 
It took my some time to figure it out but I was able to take the lead over the project and make it more exciting and engaging for other team members. Implementing some management tools, supporting the team and making them feel the sense in it was a great success.

On graduation, most of my classmates that participated I this class tutorials all testified that it helped in boosting their academic performance.
In terms of research, I joined a research team in my department called iLabs; iLabs was involved in several activities such as, development of online labs, robotics using Lego Mindstorms kit with other Hi-tech peripherals and electronics. I participated in all of these activities, by being part of the team that worked on a soccer robot, which some team members used to participate in World Robotics Olympiad in 2013. As a part of this team, I also coached elementary and high school students on robotics using Lego Mindstorms kit.
Finally, as a part of this team, my final year project was on “development of a suite online laboratories for physics and chemistry experiments”. This project aimed at addressing the challenge of inadequate laboratory set ups in African universities. The project therefore provides students access to virtual laboratories where they perform some of their physics and chemistry experiments. The project was developed with a 2D game development tool called Construct 2.  From this project, I wrote a paper for publication in the American Society for Engineering Educators (ASEE) conference proceedings, which I went ahead to present at the society’s annual conference in June 2014 at Indianapolis.
As an undergraduate, I was an active member of the Institute of Electronics and Electrical Engineering. As a member of the student branch in my university, I participated in general assemblies and meet-ups, where we discuss latest developments in the technological industry around the world and our environment. After 2 years of membership, I spent my remaining years taking up several executive roles in the body, where I became actively involved in planning these events and outreaches to high schools, to encourage the involvement of more girls in engineering. Being a member and an executive of IEEE OAUSB provided me a platform to meet other people in my fields who are interested in technology, interact wih them and develop myself, it also provided me the opportunity of helping in encouraging more girls to pursue engineering as a career.
During my undergraduate days, I also had an opportunity to participate in an internship program with the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria. As an intern, I was involved in activities with the utilities department which included: running and maintenance of the gas turbines, ups systems, generators etc. I also executed for the company which was titled “improvement of the maintenance strategy for high and low voltage cables”.  In executing this project I had to review the causes and trend of cable failures in the system, analyse the data, research on available solutions to the problem and make recommendation.
",I would be observing my compulsory national youth service in my country,More than 10 hours per week,"It has always been my desire to learn programming. I've picked up several languages like Java, C++, Perl, Python, but I have never gone through with any, I find myself stopping before halfway.  
I have tried learning programming through several methods like online tutorials, books etc, but none of them seemed to have worked for me. However, I currently use a 2D game development software called Construct 2 (it uses event-based programming). My observation while using this tool was that I got better in working with it as I worked on projects. The motivation here was the fact that I had no option than to complete the projects, hence I always had to find solutions to the problems I encountered.
With this, I believe this project-based approach is most likely the solution to me learning proper programming. Being a scholar in the Learn IT program is definitely going to provide me with the opportunity to achieve this as I would be working on a time-bound project which I must complete.
I would like to learn programming because of my interest in computer science and my knowledge of the opportunities in the technology industry. I want to be part of the key game players when it comes to technicalities in this field and not just a surface observer or participant.
",Very well,I have very little knowledge of C++,"I would love to develop a finger print based voting system.

This is a system which is still not in place in my country even though it is not a new idea and is one which I would like to develop myself to acquire the skills I need and put out for implementation first in simple departmental election processes in my department and then extend to the country at large if possible, This project is also a bridge of software and hardware which what i've always been interested in.
",A friend,"Few months back, I had to host an event called the Girl in ICT day. The objective of the program was to bring secondary school girls together and enlighten them about ICT, and the opportunities available to them.
As the Chairperson of Women in Engineering in my Institution, it was my duty to ensure the success of this program as it was the peak of our tenure. The major challenges we had ahead: raising funds for the event, getting participating students to come over to the campus, getting speakers for the event, having a rich program.
I solved these challenges by first assigning duties properly to my team members, so that even though I have to bother about everything, I still have people to shed some of the worries to. In order to raise funds for the event, we basically listed out our needs and our focus was to get people to meet individual needs and not someone to meet all the needs. 
We were able to successfully get someone who volunteered to take care of the feeding and also be our guest speaker (although we desired to have to women from the industry).   Some other groups and individuals volunteered to take care of the souvenir added to the ones we got from the WIE international bodies. Members of the teams were able to also raise suggestions on activities we could have during the program such as showcasing a game developed by a team of female students, puzzle games for the participating schools etc.
As usual some of my team members were sluggish in performing their duties, but most times they all sat up to their responsibilities anytime I give them a call to remind them of what is expected of them
An appraisal of the program showed that it was a success as feedback from the participants showed that some were already interested in ICT and a particular girl who wanted to study architecture was talking about how she could combine computer science with architecture by developing games on buildings and structures etc. The general response from the participants and observers showed that they are got the message, were inspired and some are considering the STEM field. 
","One of the leadership roles I’ve acted in is being the Outreach coordinator for my student fellowship in school- Christ Ambassadors Student Outreach (CASOR).
As the outreach coordinator my duties were to organise and plan outreaches for the fellowship at large, see to the welfare and development of members of my team etc.  On resuming office, the first major challenges I had observed and looked forward to addressing were the issue of funds for the unit and ensuring a good number of the member of the fellowship were involved in the outreach activities. 
Generally, a new tenure starts towards the end of the academic session, so I the strategy used to raise funds was based on this fact. 3 weeks to the end of the session, I made my unit members prepare a list of all the materials needed for a regular outreach program as held every semester. On getting this, I passed a list around in the fellowship for people to make pledges on which material they wanted to donate towards the outreaches in the next academic session, either in cash or kind. Since it was the end of the session, the ideology behind this was that, we expect people to have some cash during the break and they can have enough time to plan and get these materials they pledged. I also assigned someone in the unit who kept sending messages to the people who pledge, asking about their welfare and reminding them of their pledges. This strategy worked, as we gathered enough materials and money on resumption of the new session, some of which still remained for my successor to use during his tenure.
The next challenge I addressed was ensuring a good number of the fellowship members participated in all the outreaches we organised. One thing I observed from previous tenures was the fact that they had outreach week, during which they have outreaches to all subunits handled by the subgroup. So far, this has not been effective as this week could fall in a period where some particular faculties are busy with their mid-semester tests or some event. I decided to split all the various outreach activities over the entire semester, such that if you don’t have time for one, you would plan for the other. We also, ensured we increased publicity for this outreaches through projection during fellowship programs, short drama during fellowship days when permitted etc. These strategies worked as different people showed up for the different outreaches, not the same set of people that have been coming over the years. Another arm of the outreach subunits which is outreach to secondary school was also revived during this tenure by making unit members choose weeks over the semester when they would go to selected school. The major objective was making people choose a suitable time for them such that they are committed to it.
The other aspect of the expected duties which had to do with members welfare was duly attend to also. I tried my best to build a personal relationship with members such that they are not shy of making their personal needs known. And immediately the need are made known, they are being met by the unit, and in the case where the unit cannot, its reported to the fellowship’s welfare office. General provisions were also provided for all members during tests and examination periods. After election of executives in the unit, I also enforced the welfare secretary to call and prepare gifts for member’s birthdays; she is also to remind me In case I forget. 
In other to ensure personal growth and good relationship between members, a prayer chain was started where every member of the unit chose a day in the week where they pray and fast for the unit. People who share the same days of the week are paired and they are each supposed to ensure the other person in their group is doing fine, comes for meetings, doesn’t lack anything etc. so, everyone was looking after someone. 
I personally tried to call and visit members as often as I could, asked about their academics frequently and just tried to ensure that most needs were met, everyone was involved in activities in the unit and people were getting along.
As unit head, I also ensured my personal wellbeing by doing all that I’ve asked people to do. I ensured I was effective in the general executive body, carry out assignments as designated by the fellowship president, update my unit supervisor on progress and plans, made myself approachable by unit members,  worked on possible recommendations from team members and other people.
The tenure was judged as a successful one based on progress made. My major measure of success was the fact that when I left school for some months for an internship position, every planned activity still went on and some people didn’t know the unit head wasn’t around. For me this showed a huge level of unity, agreement and maturity in my members. Regular calls and check-ups on individuals during this period showed that they were all involved in the work together and it showed they had grown. Also, I was able to leave something’s for my successor to use to start up his tenure materially and financially, unlike I who met nothing in the account.
","The little programming i've done involved the use of a 2D game development tool called construct 2. I use this tool to develop virtual laboratories for some physics and chemistry experiments such as ohms-law, specific heat capacity etc, (one of the labs is at http://ilab-ohmslaw.appspot.com/). This programming tool is an event- based tool, that uses event sheets for programming, the programmer specifies conditions and then assigns actions to them. In the use of the tool, i learnt logic, functions, etc. In developing the project, i came out with the plan and structure for the work and developed with the software. External plugins developed my users could also be used in the project to achieve behaviours needed.

11/1/2014 0:48:57,6,Ścierska,Karolina,Female,Poland,scierska.karolina@gmail.com,I'm just learning to code,In high school I was at humanities and then I studied polish philology. I had traineeships in schools - I was teaching Polish language to children. Recently I've ended six-months internship in Contemporary Art Gallery where I've led workshops and artistic events.,"I am working part-time, I am a volunteer",3-5 hours per week,"This program is a rare opportunity to learn a few things at a blow. 

First - I can learn how to code. That will give me a chance to find a job, which I can't do in my own profession (I've finished polish philology). And, besides, I think it's just something you should know these days.

Secondly - I can improve my language skills. In fact, it's the first time I've written anything longer in English in five years. And I'm really sorry that you have to read it. However, like my friend always says: ""I'm sorry for my English, but I'm sure it's much better than your Polish"".

Thirdly - I want to learn how to think in this strict, precise, mathematical mode, which is obvious for coders, but not for regular people.

There are many other things I can learn, of course, but I think these are the most important.",Good enough,I do not know any programming language,"I'm thinking about establishing my own business activity so a simple, single web-page would be great. 
But also, when I was leading my projects I was thinking about something which will help me to run it, because there were many people, more children and even more things to do at the same time. If I had something to control where are everybody, when we have to do and what we have to do it would be a lot easier. ",A friend,"I finished two projects, both were similar, as also my role in them. They were about art education and equality of opportunity for children and young people from foster care. 

I was a co-organizer and one of the art instructors. I was helping children and young people with making jewellery, sewing or upcycling ugly stuff to something nice, useful and beautiful.

The most challenging thing was to keep the children focused and interested in tasks. At first I had to find out what do they like and how do they work. They didn't, they were quickly bored and dispirited. 

When I realized it's not because they are indolent, but it's just because the things which are simple for me were very complicated for them, I was able to separate tasks into small (tiny) steps and then help the children step by step. It didn't solve every problem, but it was a breakthroug in our work. ","I was a leader in this two educational projects. Me and my friend were initiators of this projects, we were together writing requests for funding.

I was looking for volunteers and instrucktors for this projects. I was also responsible for organizing our meetings and for division of responsibilities. I had to watch our schedule and make sure if we've done everything what we've planned to.

 ","I don't know how to program and I haven't done any homework or any personal project in this field. I don't count this one time in high school when I've had to do a simple web page in HTML, because it was 7(!) years ago and I don't remember even, if I've made it.
","C++, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, jQuery","In first case I think that first thing which I would have to do is to think about my page and what I would put in there. Then I would take a pen (I'm old-fashioned) and write down every texts. And, probably, I would doodle the web-page look. It would take me a while, maybe hour or two.
Next are the hard parts which are: 
- finding a place in the Web - I know that you have to buy a domain but where to do this and how, I have no idea.
- writing THE CODE (in other words: black magic) which probably takes forever.
- some testing if everything works and looks like it should.
- fixing the ugly parts.
- more voodoo to put this into the Internet.

And for the second one - I have no idea because I didn't know how to start even on paper.",Poland,GMT+1,"Home language, English"

In addition, working as a leader, I was responsi for coordination of the work of the entire team and I had to check if all people have done their job in a timely manner and support team both essentially and organisationally.","When I worked as a leader in audit, I had to organize appropriate resources (team), and distribiute the tasks  in a manner that permits to perform the project in a timely manner.The task could be performed most efficiently, when I knew the strong points of each team member. I had to define clear goals and a timetable. It was also important to create an atmosphere of friendship, support and commitment to the project. In this way the problems were quickly resolved (thanks to team support). Moreover all members of the team felt responsible  both for their tasks and the project as a whole","A few years ago I learned how to program in Delphi and Matlab.

It's hard to tell with my level of knowledge (which is 'zero'),Geek Girls Carrots,"When it comes to past projects I think about one I completed thanks to my great determination. I was studying Radio&TV Journalism (as post-graduate studies) in 2012. Usually as an addition to the graduation ceremony there was also vernissage of best photoreports made by students. 2012 was different because of the conflict that started between the journalism students and PR students connected with management of the faculty. There was no will of the management to follow the tradition and they wanted to avoid vernissage.

I was really upset as it was personal decision and it was unfair so I decided to do everything that's necessary to organize the photoreports exhibition. First I had to find the place - I walked around the city center with a friends and found one that agreed to show photos for free but it was shut by city government about 3 weeks before the vernissage. So again I had to look for some place. And again one of the spaces agreed! But we had no money to present our works and I knew that others are not so determined to pay for it. That time I worked for a big architecture company and I just went to the President of that company and asked about sponsorship. Not much, but still it's money. It was surprising but they agreed with pleasure (and since then I know for sure that you never receive something if you don't ask).

So we did it! Me with huge help of couple of friends, though I know that I was motivating them to be active and to complete it. And the graduation ceremony was honoured by great vernissage. ","Funny that I always was seen as a leader in groups though not always I considered myself as one. It changed for good in last couple of years. 

Maybe that's because I always fight when it comes to important things like values etc. When I was studying criminology at Warsaw University the authorities changed the rules of students admissions for one of the specializations and many of my colleagues didn't get to the specialization they dreamed of. I couldn't stand the injustice (though I personally got in!). I wrote an open letter to the authorities and collected almost 100 signatures of students from our year below it. I called authorities to explain the situation and to revise the circumstances. It was read by one of the professors during the Faculty Council Meeting and it caused a big discussion around it. 

Finally the Council agreed with the letter and revised decisions for all students. I didn't feel like it's a victory, it felt like it's justice for me.

Also I rarely stay quiet when something is important. Maybe I should think more about myself, care about my good only and shut up but I just can't.","Never have coded yet! But I kind of started Python basic course in Coursera.org once. Though it was difficult for me to learn via Internet so I couldn't go through the course :(.

My current project is planning NYC trip. I love travelling and I always set the goal and then make it come true. I spend hours on organizing my trips. And when I'm travelling it's all about eating and taking photos; I am a huge fan of pgotography, especially war photography and photojournalism.

At work our current project is BoxOfAds.com and I am responsible to improve the customer retention and lower the churn. Also I love to communicate with users as their feedback is extremely helpful when it comes to developing the product.

First, I would like to build the website around stories of Romanians, coming from all walks of life. Together, these candid stories about students, elderly, educators, business people, farmers etc. will portray the picture of how diverse and interesting our nation is. 
Each story will be connected with detailed information about the region and topic the story is about. 
Users will land on a homepage that has a dynamic map of Romania. The map will be split in the historic regions of Romania (Ardean, Banat, Molvoda etc.). By hovering over each region, a pop-up will show the name of the region and explain what the region is famous for (e.g. for Ardeal, we could say they are the slow of talk and slow of walk people of the country, with great traditions and delicious food etc.). Users can click any of the regions what will take them to a newsfeed of stories of people from those regions (more to be added regularly). After reading each story, they will have the chance to learn more about the region from where that person is (places to see, what is traditional to eat there, where to stay etc.).

The final result was a website we have developed together with a contractor. I was involved in the design of the website as well and really enjoyed the experience. 
Talking about challenges, there were quite a few: from finding the right framework to fit with the needs of our colleagues, to get some colleagues signed up to help with the initiative, to design the website to match the expectations and needs of our community, to launch the platform and engage colleagues in using it. 
I think the most exciting challenge was developing the website, from scratch. It was new for me to start thinking about the user experience, functionalities, how to arrange content on a page but also having the back-end in mind. We went through a few months of planning and design but, eventually, because of a consistent plan I put together for testing and developing with key groups around the team, we used innovative and interesting functionalities for the website. These captured the interest of our colleagues and keeps them engaged with the platform.

For 6 years, I led teams of students in Romania (Iasi and country) and United Kingdom in delivering the communication strategy for the organisation and a range of other projects (i.e. a career fair organised in Iasi, named Zilele Carierei). The teams I have coordinated ranged from small (4-5 people) to medium (10-15) and to very big (40). My role was to work with them strategically (especially the small teams who had their own teams to manage), coaching and mentoring (for most of my teams) and overall management.
In my current role, which is a corporate one, I am leading communications initiatives in the space of external relations. A recent one was the launch campaign for a book. My role was to bring together they key of stakeholders part of the effort and manage their contribution in the context of the overall campaign. That means working with authors, publisher, publicist, media agency, digital team, CRM team etc. 
I think I was fortunate enough to have access to quite a few leadership opportunities and each and every one of them helped me become the professional and person I am today. I'm looking forward to the next experiences that I hope will be as intense and exciting as the past ones.

This should take a day (given that it needs some creative thinking and writing).
Second, I would need to create a process of gathering stories. Ideally, I should start with a story from each region ready for the launch of the website. The stories will be created by interviewing Romanians and posting the content regularly - one a month. This is an on-going task that will take over most of my time. Researching the people, getting in touch with them, interviewing and writing the story could take from a few days to a few weeks. 
Third, I would have to research the touristic information for each region. This content will be constantly evolving, depending on the stories I will gather. However, for launch, I should have the info related to the stories I'm planning to post. This task is another on-going one that will take most of my time.

Define scoping of the project - Includes all the details relevant to the project, what kind of content will be stored, as well as all the functions required for each type of user that interacts with the system. That can include the gathering of information from external sources, helping determine the best way to deliver the content to end users.
Definition and planning of all the technical aspects of the project. -Based on requirements, the definition of the best language(s) to be used as well as the most effective tools for those languages. That can include the time invested in research as well as potential tools already existing on the market that can provide some of the core functionality required.
Development - Based on the defined milestones and tasks, the full process of transforming the defined project into a fully working application/system.
Internal/External Testing - Cross reference with internal and external users before to the launch of the project, to make sure the application doesnt have any potential errors. This can include going back to the previous step to correct those issues and proceed again to the testing phase.
The launch - That will include setting up the application/website in a permanent hosting, publicly reachable for the end users to be able to start using the system.",United Kingdom,GMT+1,English

I particularly enjoyed organising myself and the small team I worked with, breaking down the project in tasks and sub-tasks, scheduling deadlines, setting up collaborative workspaces and assigning responsibilities. The first step was to better understand what CRM entails, analysing the best practices on the market and reviewing existing CRM products. Next we gathered the internal requirements inside the company regarding the new CRM system, which helped us narrow down our previous selection. We continued by testing 2-3 systems and importing contacts. Soon we were producing a step by step handbook to guide team members on the use of such a system.

I thought it was too hard and impossible for me to learn and practice.

Role: product manager; 

Team: 1 web designer; 1 video editor

Main deliverables: decide the marketing angle and strategy for the webinar; build and implement web pages for the whole masterclass flow (approx. 10 web pages); write copy for the pages and the emails that accompany the masterclass launch; record and edit videos; manage design deliverables (banners, covers, workbooks etc.); approve all deliverables with the management.

Timeline: 3 weeks

Challenges: 
-time constraints: there is a basic process for the masterclass launch, which usually lasts 6-8 weeks; we had to do everything in 3 weeks. My solution: thorough planning and early start of work for the deliverables that required more time; lean approach (eliminated elements that didn't bring too much value to the end result)
-resources constraints: usually there's a PM on a project like this, managing the deliverables; also a copywriter that writes all the copy (especially for the sales page). My solution: I took on both roles on the project to make it happen. 
-knowledge constraints: the web designer I worked with never did this type of masterclass, so he didn't know the logic of the websites. My solution: I implemented the page together with him and made sure all the required elements were in place (SEO, tracking, analytics etc.)

Result of project: masterclass delivered in time, successful, metrics in the average recorded at the company. 

Success factors:
-planning: I've focused on priorities and made sure the most important and lengthy deliverables were started at the beginning of the project (e.g. sales page wouldn't be built without the copy, I gave the designer a dummy copy - structure - for him to build it and updated copy afterwards)
-communication: I communicated to my team that we don't have enough time to deliver the project and we will have to work lean and might put extra time on the project. I won their support and dedication to make it happen.
-QA testing: we discovered a lot of bugs and glitches at the testing before the masterclass; having a process for the testing helped to make sure the online event happened undisturbed. ","I am a natural leader, so I step up every single time I see the opportunity.
Examples:
-I took over the organization of an event on data in our company, as there was nobody to make it happen and they wanted to cancel it; 
-I started Girls Who Code Romania back home, together with two wonderful girls
-I take lead and responsibility of any project I manage (as a product manager, it's part of my job) and I build relationships with my team; an example of this is that I had a bug with one of the projects I was working on, and 4 developers jumped in to help me (I only needed one), while these guys are so busy that most of the time there is nobody to work on emergencies
-I was a project manager for years - leadership is implied, otherwise you're never successful at this job :) 
-as a consultant for 5 years, i took lead of all my projects and teams 
-it all started with being head of the class in high-school; then university. ","I know mostly to build / edit sites - html, CSS - but only basic skills.

5. Start building the MVP: 2 months (1 developer, full-time working on the app); need: server, data-base, web app, front-end (html, CSS); (responsible: developer)
6. QA testing of MVP (internally): 2 weeks (responsible: developer; I can assist)
7. Testing MVP externally (friends): 2 weeks (responsible: me)
8. Implementing feedback from tests: 2 weeks (responsible: developer)
9. Releasing beta version: at the end of the tests (responsible: developer)
10. Collecting user feedback: 1 month (ongoing) (responsible: me)
11. Implementing feedback: 1 months (responsible: developer)
12. Developing full product: ~7 months (responsible: team)

Important notes:
-weekly check-up of features, and prioritization of next move (agile development)
-testing doesn't happen only when the MVP is built, but once every feature is completed
-during the developing, we can test the product on friends, to make sure we have a user base interested",Malaysia,GMT+8,English

To achieve that we had to change change workflow with our IT team, from provider-client model to more partner relationships. But it worked out and still works well.
","In my spare time I love to take part in kayaking trips. I also often organize them. During first trip organized on my own we had very difficult weather conditions. It was rainy and cold (the trip took place in June, so not many people were prepared for 10 degrees Celsius). Everybody were tired, we were in the middle of nowhere. I decided that we need to stop kayaking and set up a camp. I already knew our group a little bit, so I knew in what activities people are filling comfortable. I managed to share tasks (like making a fire, bringing clean water, cooking dinner) that way, that after short time everything was ready, and we could take a rest, eat tasty meal and get warm. And on the next day the sun shined… :)","I am now working on “Otwarte Zabytki” (“Open Historical Monuments”).

The biggest challenge isn't looking for a perfect match (I mean the candidate) or even finding a way to contact him ( we weren't allowed to text them, we had to make a call - so we were doing extremely everything to get their phone numbers). The biggest challenge was to explain that you are calling him/ her to give them A CHANCE to change something and this opportunity might appear only once in a lifetime. People are afraid of everything that is NEW (for them). The thing is, people forget that miracles happens  when you leave your comfort zone ;)
Completing the project means finding the perfect match for the position you are hunting people and then ""sell"" you candidate to you client (so the company).

I love to have a purpose and I enjoy the whole journey to achieve my goal. I try not to be bossy and I usually moderate the discussion to verify if everybody had a chance to speak up. 
That's what happened this morning during the workshop (creating space - Design thinking), when the group was too big to let it self-organize, I became sort of a moderator or even a leader, that helps the team to end up the task.","I have a basic knowledge of HTML, SQL and some Python.","Java, Python, Ruby, PHP, SQL, Objective-C (iOS), Scala, Swift","I need to start with getting some real, useful knowledge of Ruby (I do know the market properly); second step would be - getting familiar with the tools; next one-  find a domain , then hosting and prepare a website with the search engine.
